**Affected**: All Python files with >5 imports  
**Success**: No unused imports, simplified graph, current deps

### Phase 5: Telemetry & Monitoring Enhancement 📊 MEDIUM
**Duration**: 4-6 hours  
**Scope**:
- Add structured logging throughout
- Enhance dashboard visualizations
- Implement alerting system
- Archive historical telemetry data

**Affected**: `core/telemetry`, all major applications  
**Success**: All critical paths logged, real-time dashboard, alerts configured

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation Suite 🧪 HIGH
**Duration**: 8-12 hours  
**Scope**:
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Add integration tests
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Performance benchmarking

**Affected**: New testing infrastructure  
**Success**: 80%+ coverage, CI/CD passing, benchmarks established

## 🛡️ CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS ACTIVE

All 5 Yama principles enforced throughout overhaul:

1. **Ahimsa** (Non-harm): No data loss, all changes reversible
2. **Satya** (Truth): All changes logged and documented
3. **Asteya** (Non-stealing): Preserve existing functionality
4. **Brahmacharya** (Restraint): Incremental changes, test each phase
5. **Aparigraha** (Non-hoarding): Ship when ready, don't over-engineer

**Rollback Triggers**:
- Test suite failure
- Constitutional constraint violation
- Data corruption detected
- Performance degradation >20%
- User-requested emergency halt

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS - AWAITING YOUR COMMAND

### To Begin Overhaul:
1. **Review** this summary and the detailed plan
2. **Prioritize** which phases to execute first
3. **Authorize** phase execution (e.g., "Begin Phase 1")
4. **Monitor** progress via telemetry and logs
5. **Validate** each phase before proceeding

### To Defer Overhaul:
1. Workers will remain idle (no resource cost)
2. System continues normal operation
3. All awareness reports preserved for later
4. Can return to this checkpoint anytime

### Emergency Procedures:
- **Abort**: "Emergency halt all overhaul work"
- **Rollback**: "Rollback to pre-overhaul checkpoint"
- **Status**: "Show overhaul progress"

## 💬 RECOMMENDED FIRST ACTIONS

Given the current state, I recommend:

1. **IMMEDIATE** (if proceeding): Start with **Phase 1 (Model Infrastructure)**
   - Already partially complete (Claude 3.7 migration done)
   - Low risk, high value
   - Can be completed in 2-4 hours
   - Sets foundation for other phases

2. **NEXT** (if Phase 1 successful): **Phase 2 (Safety Hardening)**
   - Critical for autonomous operations
   - Builds on awareness scan findings
   - Ensures overhaul process is safe

3. **ALTERNATIVE** (if deferring): Focus on **manuscript revision**
   - Address Phase 8 semantic validation findings
   - Consolidate duplicate sections
   - Strengthen AI safety connection for CAIS
   - Get manuscript submission-ready first
