  message: No specific receipts or swarm findings were provided for validation in
    Current knowledge. Please supply data (receipts and/or swarm_findings) to proceed.
  reason: No 'extracted_receipts' or 'swarm_findings' were provided in Current knowledge.
    Only a prior notice indicating missing data was present.
  recommendations:
  - Provide extracted_receipts[] and swarm_findings{} to enable validation.
  - Include OCR text or source artifacts (image/pdf hashes or URIs) for cross-checks.
  - Provide currency, tax rates, and locale/country for correct tax and compliance
    validation.
  - If receipts are multi-currency, include exchange rate source and timestamp.
  required_inputs:
    extracted_receipts: Array of receipt objects (see expected_schemas.extracted_receipt)
    swarm_findings: Object detailing consensus, discrepancies, and agent votes (see
      expected_schemas.swarm_findings)
