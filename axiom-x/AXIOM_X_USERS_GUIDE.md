# AXIOM-X: YOUR AI ORCHESTRATION SYSTEM
## The Simple Guide to Getting Things Done Faster

### 🎯 What Is Axiom-X?

**In one sentence:** Axiom-X coordinates multiple AI assistants to work together on big tasks, following ethical rules to ensure safe and high-quality results.

**Think of it like:**
- A conductor leading an orchestra of AI musicians
- A project manager coordinating a team of specialists
- A quality control system that ensures good work

**The key difference:** Instead of asking one AI to do everything (slow), Axiom-X breaks work into pieces and assigns them to hundreds of AI workers simultaneously (fast).

## 📊 WHAT CAN AXIOM-X DO?

### Feature 1: Multi-Provider Orchestration
**What it means in plain English:**
- Uses 6 different AI companies at once (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, Cohere, Fireworks)
- If one is slow or breaks, others keep working
- Never locked into one company's limitations

**When to use it:**
- You have lots of similar tasks (analyze 100 documents, write 50 emails)
- You need results fast
- You want backup options if one AI service has problems

**Example use cases:**
- "Analyze these 200 research papers and summarize key findings"
- "Generate 100 product descriptions for my catalog"
- "Review 500 support tickets and categorize them"

**Quick Start Prompt:**
```
I need to [task] for [number] items. Use multi-provider orchestration for speed.

Examples:
- "I need to summarize 50 PDFs. Use multi-provider orchestration for speed."
- "I need to generate SEO descriptions for 200 products. Use multi-provider orchestration."
```

**What happens:** Axiom-X splits your 50 tasks across 6 AI providers, completing in ~2 minutes instead of 30 minutes.

---

### Feature 2: Constitutional Governance
**What it means in plain English:**
- Every decision follows ethical rules (based on ancient Yama principles)
- Always asks permission before deleting anything
- Keeps receipts proving work was done correctly
- Transparent about confidence levels ("I'm 90% sure" vs "I'm 50% sure")

**When to use it:**
- Working with important documents
- Making decisions that affect others
- Need to prove work meets ethical standards
- Want audit trail for compliance

**Example use cases:**
- "Review these legal contracts and flag risky clauses" (needs high accuracy + ethics)
- "Analyze employee feedback and summarize concerns" (needs confidentiality)
- "Recommend budget cuts" (needs transparency about tradeoffs)

**Quick Start Prompt:**
```
[Your task] - Use constitutional governance to ensure ethical compliance.

Examples:
- "Analyze customer complaints - Use constitutional governance to ensure privacy."
- "Recommend which features to cut - Use constitutional governance for transparent tradeoffs."
```

**What happens:** Axiom-X follows ethical rules (non-harm, truthfulness, proper attribution) and provides confidence scores with every answer.

### Feature 3: Fractal Parallelization (Swarm Mode)
**What it means in plain English:**
- Breaks big problems into smaller pieces
- Assigns pieces to hundreds of AI workers
- Combines results intelligently
- 50-100× faster than working alone

**When to use it:**
- Massive tasks (thousands of items)
- Complex analysis requiring multiple perspectives
- Time-sensitive projects
- Research requiring comprehensive coverage

**Example use cases:**
- "Scan my entire codebase (1,000+ files) and find security vulnerabilities"
- "Research all competitors in my industry and create comparison matrix"
- "Analyze 10 years of financial data and identify patterns"

**Quick Start Prompt:**
```
[Large task] - Deploy swarm mode with [number] workers.

Examples:
- "Analyze all 500 customer reviews - Deploy swarm mode with 100 workers."
- "Find duplicates in my 2,000 file photo library - Deploy swarm mode with 200 workers."
```

**What happens:** Axiom-X spawns hundreds of specialized workers, completes your task in minutes instead of hours/days.

---

### Feature 4: Receipt-Based Performance Tracking
**What it means in plain English:**
- Every time a script runs, it saves a "report card"
- Report cards show speed, quality, and success/failure
- System learns which scripts work best
- Automatically uses top performers for future tasks

**When to use it:**
- Building tools you'll reuse
- Want to know what's working vs failing
- Need proof of performance for stakeholders
- Optimizing workflows over time

**Example use cases:**
- "I run daily reports - track which scripts are fastest"
- "Testing different approaches - show me which performed best"
- "Need to prove my AI system is improving over time"

**Quick Start Prompt:**
```
[Your task] - Generate performance receipt for tracking.

Examples:
- "Run data analysis pipeline - Generate performance receipt for tracking."
- "Benchmark these 5 approaches - Generate performance receipts to compare."
```

**What happens:** Axiom-X saves detailed performance data (speed, quality, errors) in JSON files you can review later.

---

### Feature 5: Canonical File Selection
**What it means in plain English:**
- Automatically identifies your "best" files
- Flags duplicate/outdated versions for cleanup
- Keeps your codebase organized
- Prevents accumulation of junk files

**When to use it:**
- Your project has grown messy
- Multiple versions of files exist
- Not sure which script to use
- Want to clean up without breaking things

**Example use cases:**
- "I have 5 versions of my data processing script - which one should I keep?"
- "My project has 1,000+ files - help me identify what's important"
- "Clean up my codebase without breaking anything"

**Quick Start Prompt:**
```
Run canonical file selection on [directory/project].

Examples:
- "Run canonical file selection on my Python project."
- "Run canonical file selection on my scripts folder - flag duplicates."
```

**What happens:** Axiom-X analyzes performance data, identifies best versions of each tool, flags redundant files for safe deletion.

---

### Feature 6: Infrastructure Workers (Continuous Development)
**What it means in plain English:**
- Background workers that generate new features
- Creates code, tests, documentation automatically
- Runs continuously while you do other work
- Like having a development team working 24/7

**When to use it:**
- Building a large system
- Need lots of code generated
- Want automated testing
- Require documentation written

**Example use cases:**
- "Generate 100 utility functions for my project"
- "Create test suites for all my modules"
- "Write API documentation for my codebase"
- "Build data processing pipelines"

**Quick Start Prompt:**
```
Deploy [number] infrastructure workers for [task type].

Examples:
- "Deploy 50 infrastructure workers for code generation."
- "Deploy 20 infrastructure workers for writing tests."
- "Deploy 30 infrastructure workers for documentation."
```

**What happens:** Axiom-X spawns background workers that continuously generate code/tests/docs while you work on other tasks.
