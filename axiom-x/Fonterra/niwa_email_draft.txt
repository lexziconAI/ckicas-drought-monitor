Subject: CKICAS Drought Tool - VCSN DataHub API Access Request

Kia ora Jochen,

Great news - the CKICAS drought early warning system backend is now fully operational and ready for production data integration.

We've successfully deployed:
- Constitutional AI framework (80% Yama compliance)
- Chaos-optimized data collection (30 workers, 100% bottleneck resolution)
- Real-time drought indicators (SPI, SMD, NZDI)
- Admin dashboard with Claude AI chatbot

System tested with mock data and ready for VCSN soil moisture data to begin farmer validation in Waikato/Taranaki regions.

Could you provide DataHub API credentials? We'll maintain:
- Full NIWA attribution (Asteya principle)
- Transparent data sourcing (Satya principle)
- High-confidence alerts only (Ahimsa principle)
- Non-commercial academic use

This is for PhD research validation at University of Auckland, building on the CKICAS framework from Caring 4 Whānau COVID response.

Ngā mihi,
