CKICAS  Iterative  Narrative s 
Overview  
This chapter provides an in -depth exploration of the Community Kinetic  Intellgent Complex 
Adapt ive Systems  Research ( CKICAS ) methodology, a novel approach conceptualised and 
refined during the tumultuous initial six to nine months of the COVID -19 pandemic. CKICAS  
came into existence not as a pre -planned research scheme but as an evolving framework, 
honed through the researcher's immersive experiences in the field and observations in real -
world settings.  
Genesis of CKICAS  
CKICAS  was not a predefined research approach t the onset of the pandemic. Instead, it 
emerged iteratively, informed by the researcher's ongoing interactions with community 
members, first -hand experiences in pandemic response, and cumulative insights from 
scholarly literature. This bottom -up evolution  allowed the methodology to be intrinsically 
aligned with the complex and dynamic realities posed by the COVID -19 crisis.  
Theoretical Foundations  
At its core, CKICAS  amalgamates key components from three foundational methodologies: 
Design Science Research, Action Research, and Community -Based Participatory Research. 
The integration of these methodologies yields a comprehensive, multi -dimensional 
framework that serves as an organising structure for the researcher's community -based 
activities.  
Design Science Research  
Incorporating elements from Design Science Research, CKICAS  places a significant emphasis on 
creating innovative solutions, often in the form of systems or models, to address pressing 
community challenges.  
Action Research  
By adopting principles from Action Research, the methodology encourages an interactive, 
cyclical process where the research not only informs action but is also revised based on the 
outcomes of that action.  
Community -Based Participatory Research  
The inclusion of Community -Based Participatory Research elements ensures that community 
members are active collaborators in the research process, thereby enriching the empirical 
data and improving the relevance and applicability of research outcomes.  
Methodological Components  
CKICAS  is structured around five interconnected stages, each serving a unique yet 
complementary role in the research process. These stages are:  
1. Observation : Initial data collection and situational analysis to understand the context and 
identify key issues.  
2. Theory Building : Formulation of hypotheses and conceptual frameworks based on initial 
observations.  

PAGE 2:
3. Systems Development : Creation of systems, models, or interventions to address identified 
issues.  
4. Community Action : Implementation of the developed systems in the community, involving 
active participation from community members.  
5. Validation : Evaluation of the outcomes to assess the effectiveness of the systems and to 
refine the underlying theories.  
Utility in the Context of COVID -19 
In the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environment of the COVID -19 
pandemic, CKICAS  has proven to be exceptionally adaptable. It has enabled the researcher 
to seamlessly shift between gathering empirical data from community -based initiatives and 
crafting theoretical models that inform subsequent stages of research.  
Retrospective Structuring  
It is noteworthy that all activities related to pandemic response have been retrospectively 
aligned with the CKICAS  methodology. This post -hoc framing provides a coherent structure 
that not only aids in the systematic reporting of research activities but also facilitates a 
nuanced analysis of the empirical data and outcomes.  
Conclusion  
Through its amalgamation of multiple research paradigms and its iterative, flexible nature, 
CKICAS  has emerged as an invaluable framework for conducting research in the uniquely 
challenging context of the COVID -19 pandemic. This chapter aims to elucidate the nuanced 
components and stages of CKICAS , offering a thorough understanding that may be valuable 
for both academic researchers and practitioners alike.  
 
1. Enhancing Institutional Pandemic Preparedness and Response  
Observation:  The unprecedented onset of the COVID -19 pandemic exposed glaring vulnerabilities 
and deficiencies in the existing pandemic preparedness protocols, procedures, and infrastructure 
within public and private institutions across sectors, including universities , public transportation 
networks, retail outlets, and media organisations. For example, even before COVID -19 arrived in 
New Zealand, from the researchers own everyday experience it was obvious that  his own  universit y  
lacked robust sanitisation and disinfe ction standards for high -touch surfaces such as computer labs 
and keyboards. Once the virus has arrived it was also obvious that p ublic transport systems did not 
have clear guidelines or messaging around mask -wearing for passengers. And r etail stores had 
inconsistent or ambiguous policies for staff and customers regarding masks and social distancing. 
Media outlets, despite being major information channels, did not always effectively communicate 
public health guidelines.  
These systemic gaps in pandemic preparedness are reminiscent of the principle highlighted by 
Nunamaker et al. (1991) concerning the centrality of problem identification and formulation in 
decision -making systems. Similarly, in the context of public health crises, the proactive identification 
of potential issues and challenges is paramount. Researchers Dryhurst et al. (2020) emphasise the 
critical nature of public understanding and adherence to measures during health crises, 
underscoring the importance of pr eparedness and timely response. For the researcher, with a PhD 

PAGE 3:
focus on Community Resilience and crisis response, the COVID -19 pandemic highlighted the pressing 
need for coordinated interventions across institutional contexts. Such coordination he believed at 
the time would be paramount to enhance pandemic preparedness capabilities and crisis response 
mechanisms amidst the escalating threat of COVID -19. 
 
Theory Building:  To gain a comprehensive perspective on the complexities at hand, the researcher 
drew upon foundational Systems Thinking, as articulated by seminal works of both Senge (1990) and 
Meadows (2008). This framing and  perspective not only provided a lens to view institutions as 
complex adaptive systems within broader socio -technical landscapes but also instilled confidence 
that, if the  researcher  were to act, it would be based on strategies grounded in empirical logic. The 
comprehensive analysis il luminated key points for initiating systemic change. Stakeholder theory 
principles (Harrison et al., 2015) highlighted the essential nature of broad cross -sector collaboration, 
emphasi sing the coordination of diverse actors in pandemic response networks. Furthermore, 
insights from recognised crisis management frameworks (Rodríguez, 2007) acted as a guiding light, 
shedding light on evidence -backed strategies for addressing public health emergencies.  
Given the unpredictability of the COVID -19 situation, the researcher adopted Chaos Theory (Lorenz, 
1963), with a specific focus on its tenet of fractality and the principle of self -similarity. This principle 
posits that patterns recur at every scale in a f ractal system, much like the way the pandemic 
mirrored similar patterns of spread and impact across different regions and populations. 
Furthermore, Chaos Theory emphasises that seemingly minor initial shifts can precipitate a cascade 
of substantial, unfore seen outcomes — a profound analogy for the pandemic's dynamic, non -linear 
progression. This theoretical grounding not only honed the researcher's understanding but also 
fortified the conviction to act amidst the pervasive uncertainties.  
In the interdisciplinary fields of behavioural economics and health psychology, the importance of 
targeted intervention strategies has been recognised. Notable concepts such as 'nudging', as 
described by Thaler and Sunstein (2008), and the Behaviour Change  Wheel, developed by Michie et 
al. (2011), highlight the necessity of tailored interventions. These concepts are particularly critical for 
reinforcing practices like social distancing and maintaining hygiene in shared spaces. By synthesising 
insights from these theoretical frameworks, the efficacy of any single intervention would  likely  be 
enhanced. Adopting such paradigms not only provides a robust theoretical underpinning but also 
assures that the resultant actions are more likely to produce meaningful outcomes.  
Systems Development:   
At the dawn of the pandemic, the researcher found themselves at an intersection of responsibility 
and capability. The question was not only how to understand the unfolding crisis through an 
academic lens but also how to wield this knowledge to effect tangi ble, ethical change.  
Relying on the foundational tenets of Systems Thinking from thought leaders like Senge (1990) and 
Meadows (2008), the researcher sought to comprehend the pandemic as a complex, interconnected 
web of challenges. But understanding was only the first step; th e goal was to translate this 
knowledge into actionable strategies.  
Guided by the ethical framework posited by Harrison et al. (2015), the researcher was acutely aware 
of the moral imperatives tied to their role. Navigating the intricate landscape of stakeholder 
relationships, there was a constant emphasis on ensuring that  interventions were both efficacious 
and ethically sound.  

PAGE 4:
The principles of collective intelligence, as expounded by Woolley et al. (2010), became pivotal in 
this endeavour. This led to a dual approach: developing bespoke interventions while also 
championing and refining existing strategies. The underlying belief  was that diverse insights, when 
unified, could craft solutions tailored to the unique needs of communities.  
To operationalise these strategies, established change models, specifically Kotter's (Kotter, 1995) 
and Lewin's (Lewin, 1946) theories, were employed. These models offered a structured pathway for 
the phased implementation of interventions, ensuring commun ity engagement and acceptance.  
The researcher's initiative at the University of Auckland stands as a testament to this approach. 
Having identified vulnerabilities in communal spaces, a robust campaign was launched advocating 
for enhanced sanitisation measures in computer labs. Despite f acing initial hurdles, the researcher's 
persistent efforts bore fruit. When the university reopened, the labs were equipped with clear 
sanitisation reminders, symbolising the confluence of rigorous academic insight and impactful real -
world change.  
Validation:   
Throughout the research process, the researcher maintained a steadfast commitment to empirical 
rigour, consistently seeking insights from domain experts. Initially, validation for the sanitisation 
initiatives was bolstered by collaboration with microbial s pecialists. As the pandemic progressed, this 
collaboration expanded to include prominent New Zealand epidemiologists, notably those credited 
with the nation's effective elimination strategies, as documented by Baker, Wilson, & Anglemyer 
(2020). Their exper tise played a pivotal role in refining the interventions and enhancing the 
credibility of the researcher's efforts.  
From the outset, the researcher decided to dedicate their energy to pragmatic current and future 
interventions, meticulously benchmarking these efforts against the academic literature. 
Foundational works in epidemiology, public health, and organisational p sychology provided the 
theoretical underpinning. This foundation ensured that current strategies, including targeted 
awareness campaigns, social media initiatives, and digital activism, were both theoretically grounded 
and empirically validated. Looking ah ead, the researcher was well -positioned to either lead or 
support innovative interventions. These anticipated strategies aim ed to address long -term pandemic 
preparedness, mental well -being during prolonged crises, community -led health initiatives, and 
enhanced public health communication.  
Collaboration with respected figures in the field was instrumental. A notable outcome of these 
partnerships was the piece spotlighting New Zealand's exemplary pandemic response. Titled "NZ as 
the beacon of light in a Covid -19 world: Lessons in solidarity, kindness, forgiveness" (Duff, 2020) and 
featured on the University of Auckland's news site, the article was enriched by invaluable advice and 
insights provided by Baker. This collaboration underscores the profound impact that expert guidance 
can have in sh aping narratives and disseminating critical information.  
Embracing a holistic approach to validation, the researcher combined formal methodologies with 
grassroots observations. Demonstrating profound commitment, the researcher dedicated significant 
hours to firsthand monitoring of sanitisation compliance outside  university computer labs. As the 
pandemic continued, the researcher took on the role of a keen observer in supermarkets, spending 
countless hours walking the aisles to informally assess the community's adherence to mask -wearing 
guidelines. These grassroot s observations, when combined with the insights and guidance from 
experts such as Baker et al. (2020), more than likely formed part of a broader societal intervention. 
While the researcher championed and contributed to understanding these community dynamic s, the 

PAGE 5:
overarching success of such interventions was a collaborative endeavour. This collective approach 
ensured that strategies were grounded in both academic rigour and the lived experiences of the 
community.  
Community Action:  
 
At the pandemic's onset, the researcher, in collaboration with close friends, initiated a collective 
named "Caring 4 Whanau." This group swiftly established a digital footprint through a website, 
Facebook page, Twitter handle, and a podcast that persisted throughout the first lockdown. As the 
researcher's public visibility expanded, he seamlessly integrated into the New Zealand chapter of 
Masks4All, a chapter of the globally recognised movement born in the Czech Republic.  
This chapter evolved into a dynamic hub of community -based public health evangelists, 
encompassing GPs, students, housewives, and others committed to public health advocacy. 
Together, the group identified and addressed gaps in pandemic preparedness across an array of 
settings, from public transport to residential complexes. The researcher, using his academic 
background and growing public presence, facilitated dialogues with key sector leaders, presenting 
data -driven proposals to an array of stakeholders, fr om transport authorities to educational 
administrators.  
During this phase, the insights of Howard, a US founder of Masks4All and lead author of a pivotal 
study (Howard et al., 2021), became invaluable. This established a collaborative nexus between 
Howard, the researcher, and the NZ Masks4All chapter, further e nriched by Baker's expertise, even 
though he wasn't an official Masks4All member.  
With this multi -faceted engagement, the Masks4All NZ chapter's credibility flourished. The 
researcher, while being an essential part of the initiative, often spearheaded media appearances, all 
the while supported by community activist allies. The collabora tive nature of these interventions 
was accentuated through press releases for various ethnic media channels. Theoretical frameworks, 
such as those by Cialdini (2001), Figueroa et al. (2002), and Graham et al. (2006), were adeptly 
employed to ensure widespr ead adoption.  
On a grassroots level, local gatherings and hyperlocal group engagements became platforms for the 
community to mould, disseminate, and supervise the interventions. Strategic social media 
campaigns further amplified the reach and sustained public engagement . 
Outcome:  
The collective efforts of the Masks4All NZ chapter, underpinned by Systems Thinking and diverse 
collaborations, adeptly addressed pandemic preparedness gaps across numerous settings. Marrying 
academic perspectives with community feedback, they crafted inte rventions resonating both in 
theory and practice. The chapter, including the researcher, became indispensable bridges between 
New Zealand's Ministry of Health and myriad stakeholders. Their media engagements, often 
spearheaded by the researcher bu t buoyed by community activists, augmented the impact and 
credibility of their endeavours. Direct community engagements further tailored interventions to 
meet specific challenges. Collectively, their approach underscores the importance of inclusive, 
stakeh older -driven strategies during health crises and offers a blueprint for future resilience -centric 
initiatives.

2. Empowering Marginalised Communities: Grassroots Interventions Amidst a Pandemic 
Crisis  
Observation:  
The sweeping emergence of the COVID -19 pandemic in early 2020 brought with it a cascade of 
challenges, most notably, an acute shortage of pivotal preventative supplies such as hand sanitisers, 
face masks, and personal protective equipment. As communities g lobally confronted these deficits, 
the complexity of the situation in South Auckland stood out due to its unique socio -cultural 
landscape and the pronounced vulnerabilities of its residents.  
The Māori and Pacific Islander communities within South Auckland, owing to various socio -economic 
and health factors, found themselves disproportionately affected. Anecdotal reports from these 
communities painted a vivid and grim portrait of their struggle s. The challenges went beyond the 
mere procurement of essential supplies. Panic -driven behaviours, such as stockpiling, compounded 
their vulnerabilities, making the shortage emblematic of the broader societal inequalities that these 
communities have histor ically faced (Marmot & Allen, 2020).  
The established supply chains, already marred by inefficiencies, seemed ill -prepared to address the 
escalating demand, especially in areas like South Auckland where the situation was exacerbated by 
pre-existing social disparities. Central to these challeng es was the observation that mainstream 
pandemic measures, which perhaps worked for broader populations, faltered when it came to 
addressing the nuanced needs of the Māori and Pacific Islanders. This inadequacy was a stark 
reminder that one -size-fits-all st rategies were insufficient for such distinct communities.  
The observational phase was pivotal in shedding light on these systemic failures. Not only did it 
provide a real -time snapshot of the immediate challenges, but it also exposed the chronic 
inadequacies in the supply mechanisms. This South Auckland narrative  resonated with Nunamaker 
et al.’s (1991) insights on the significance of informed decision -making. Equipped with accurate 
insights, there emerge d an opportunity for proactive identification and mitigation of community -
specific challenges before they ampli fied into full -blown crises. Moreover, this scenario dovetailed 
with Kruk et al.'s (2015) discussions on the health system's resilience, highlighting the pressing need 
for anticipatory strategies and grassroots innovation to bridge the glaring gaps brought to light by 
the pandemic.  
Theory Building:  
Addressing the intricate challenges faced by the Māori and Pacific Islander communities necessitated 
an underpinning of robust theoretical frameworks. Such an approach would not only illuminate the 
complexities of the situation but also pave the way for ta ilored interventions. Central to this 
theoretical exploration were Systems Thinking principles, as elucidated by both Senge (1990) and 
Meadows (2008). This paradigm provided an invaluable perspective, enabling a holistic view of 
vulnerable communities as i ntricate, interconnected systems. Through this dual lens, the 
multifaceted factors shaping community dynamics could be more thoroughly understood, allowing 
for a granular examination of the prevalent challenges.  
However, the broader view of Systems Thinking was complemented by delving into the realm of 
social innovation theories (Mulgan , 2007). Recognising that community -centric solutions often yield 
the most pertinent resolutions to complex societal challenges (Israel et al., 1998), this theoretical 
framework accentuated the importance of pioneering locale -specific strategies, especiall y in periods 

PAGE 7:
of crisis. Such a stance underscored the need for inventive ideation and a shift from traditional top -
down approaches. Importantly, it also highlighted the importance of integrating the cultural 
nuances, practices, and values intrinsic to the Māori and Pac ific communities, ensuring that 
interventions were not only innovative but also culturally respectful.  
The social determinants of health model added another dimension to this theoretical framework, 
offering insights into the myriad socio -economic, cultural, and environmental factors that influence 
community health (Marmot et al., 2008). This model delved de ep into the root causes of community 
vulnerabilities, grounding the research in a profoundly contextual understanding. Complementing 
this, principles from design science (Hevner et al., 2004) were woven into the theoretical 
exploration. Renowned for their meticulous approach to problem delineation and solution crafting, 
these principles endowed the researcher with robust tools for both investigation and intervention 
development.  
To bring this theoretical approach full circle, the principles and methodologies of participatory action 
research were embraced (Susman & Evered, 1978; Reason & Bradbury, 2008). Championing a 
collaborative approach, this methodology underscored the importa nce of the community's active 
participation in crafting solutions. Such an approach ensured that the devised interventions were 
rooted deeply within the community, tailored to their unique needs, and designed in collaboration 
with them.  
Systems Development:  
In the wake of COVID -19's emergence in New Zealand, the imperative to craft immediate and 
sustainable solutions was magnified by the prevailing atmosphere of collective responsibility. This 
sense of urgency necessitated the development of tangible, communi ty-centric interventions 
tailored to the unique challenges faced by South Auckland.  
In response, the researcher, building on pre -established insights and relationships, prioritised forging 
trusted collaborations with Māori and Pacific stakeholders. These collaborations birthed a series of 
targeted initiatives that were informed by the pri nciples of social innovation frameworks (Mulgan, 
2007) and steered by design science methodologies (Hevner et al., 2004). These interventions, 
grounded in South Auckland's societal context, epitomised the transformative potential of 
grassroots initiatives in addressing overwhelming challenges.  
A flagship intervention was the backyard sanitiser production project, helmed by the researcher. 
This endeavour, inspired by Mulgan's social innovation tenets, highlighted the efficacy of 
community -led solutions in tackling global challenges. By locally so urcing key components, such as 
ethanol, and adhering to guidelines set by the WHO, this initiative showcased how hyperlocal efforts 
could fill the void left by disrupted, larger -scale supply chains.  
In tandem, the "Communities Take Action!" workshop materialised in South Auckland, co -developed 
by the researcher in consultation with key community leaders. This workshop, a blend of knowledge 
dissemination and collaborative action, served as both a pract ical and educational platform. With 
sessions like community -oriented mask -making workshops and in -depth discussions fostering 
community resilience, it acted as a prototype for potential community -driven initiatives that could 
be adapted and replicated in d iverse contexts.  
Championing participatory action research principles (O’Brien et al., 2007), the researcher facilitated 
dialogues, identifying community vulnerabilities and strategising on amplifying community assets. 
These collaborative discussions paved the way for the co-creation of grassroots strategies, 
meticulously tailored to resonate with the needs and priorities of Māori and Pacific communities.  

PAGE 8:
Cumulatively, these endeavours fostered a collective sense of purpose and empowerment, 
bolstering the community's ability to proactively tackle crises. Integrating the spirit of social 
innovation, capitalising on pre -existing community networks, and nurtur ing collaborative ethos, 
these initiatives solidified the foundation for enduring community resilience, even amidst 
monumental challenges.  
Validation:  
To ensure the efficacy, safety, and cultural pertinence of the interventions, a rigorous validation 
process was meticulously orchestrated. The validation extended beyond mere empirical vetting; it 
sought to amalgamate scientific rigor with deep -rooted community wisdom.  Initially, empirical 
consultations set the tone for validation. The researcher liaised with public health experts, 
particularly those affiliated with the University of Auckland. Their expertise was instrumental in 
providing real -time validation for both th e sanitiser formula and the mask designs, ensuring that the 
interventions w ere anchored in empirical evidence and adhered to best practices.  
Simultaneously, it was paramount to ensure that the interventions resonated with the communities 
they intended to serve  (Israel et al., 1998) . In line with this ethos, the researcher initiated continual 
dialogues with community leaders, healthcare workers, and representatives from the Māori and 
Pacific communities. Conversations, guided by the principles of Nelson & Prilleltensky (2010), were 
pivotal in tailoring interventions to be culturally sensitive and contextually pertinent. This iterative 
feedback lo op, added layers of cultural and contextual relevance, ensuring that each initiative was 
deeply rooted in Māori and Pacific values.  
Community -driven validation emerged as another linchpin in the validation process. Adhering to the 
principles of social innovation (Mulgan, 2007) and participatory research methods (Reason & 
Bradbury, 2008), the community was positioned not as a mere benef iciary but as an active 
participant in the validation journey. This approach championed the ethos that for an intervention to 
truly be effective, it must be validated by the very community it seeks to aid.  Later stages of 
validation expanded the scope even  further. They integrated contemporary mediums, incorporating 
feedback from social media analytics and liaisons with community -based organisations, such as the 
Lions Club and Rotary. This multi -tiered, integrative validation approach ensured that the 
inter ventions were scientifically robust, culturally aligned, and deeply embedded within the 
community's fabric, offering a holistic perspective on their potential impact and efficacy.  
Community Action:  
 
The pandemic, while presenting unprecedented challenges, also illuminated opportunities to 
leverage the transformative potential of community action. At the heart of the researcher's 
approach lay an unwavering commitment to social innovation and participat ory action research, 
with the goal of mobilising communities towards enduring grassroots solutions.  
To maximise the impact of developed interventions, the researcher, alongside a dedicated group of 
community activists, championed a dual -pronged dissemination strategy. Initially, digital outreach 
was employed, tapping into the expansive reach of social me dia platforms. Knowledge on sanitiser -
making techniques and mask -crafting instructions were disseminated, ensuring broad accessibility 
and real -time engagement, particularly among younger demographics. This initiative resonated with 
Mulgan’s emphasis on pr oliferating innovative solutions in social innovation (Mulgan, 2007).  

PAGE 9:
Recognising the limitations of solely relying on digital means, the researcher also sought 
collaboration with traditional community entities, such as the Lions Club and Rotary Club. These 
alliances, deeply entrenched in the principles of social innovation,  leveraged the considerable 
influence and trust these organisations held within communities. Thus, grassroots initiatives, even if 
originating from a single community hall, could resonate on a larger scale, amplifying their impact.  
Central to this community action ethos was the aspiration to cultivate resilience. Through consistent 
feedback, community dialogues, and monitoring, interventions were continually refined, aiming not 
just to address the pandemic's immediate challenges but also to enhance long -term community 
resilience. Relationships, either with grassroots leaders or institutional entities, formed the 
foundation for lasting partnerships. This comprehensive approach not only prepared communities to 
tackle the immediate ramif ications of the pandemic but also strengthened their readiness for 
potential future challenges.  
Outcomes:  
Amidst the unprecedented challenges of the COVID -19 pandemic, the community -centric 
interventions in South Auckland realised tangible and impactful results. Through collaborative 
efforts, over 400 litres of hand sanitiser were produced and distributed acro ss diverse community 
groups and churches, ensuring that essential protective measures reached even the most 
vulnerable. Parallel to this, a proactive mask -making initiative gained momentum in local high 
schools, promoting a proactive response among the you nger population. These endeavours, deeply 
rooted in the synergies of health, participatory research, and community empowerment theories, 
successfully addressed the immediate necessities posed by the pandemic. More importantly, they 
laid a foundation for fo stering resilience, empowerment, and health equity in these communities, 
preparing them for future challenges.  
 
3. Bolstering Mask Advocacy Through Online Communities of Practice  
Observation:  
In the nascent stages of the COVID -19 pandemic's global ramifications, the researcher undertook an 
initiative characterised by both its simplicity and pertinence. Adorning a home -constructed t -shirt 
inscribed with the emblematic phrase, "My mask protects you, your mask protects me," the 
researcher subtly yet effectively underscored the mutual reciprocity inherent in mask -wearing. This 
act, while modest, garnered attention from  local media outlets, thereby accentuating its pertinence 
amidst the prevailing public health discourse.  
The media's coverage of this initiative serendipitously intersected with the interests of the principal 
figures spearheading the New Zealand chapter of Masks4All — a movement with its genesis in the 
Czech Republic. Recognising the confluence of their objec tives with the researcher's proactive 
stance, an invitation for collaborative engagement was proffered. As the researcher integrated into 
this collective, he rapidly emerged as a pivotal entity within the Masks4All NZ infrastructure. This 
assembly matured into a diverse conglomeration of individuals, spanning general practitioners, 
students, and homemakers, yet unified by their fervent dedication to the principles of public health 
advocacy.  
Leveraging the dynamic nature of online communities, the chapter, bolstered by the researcher's 
academic expertise and growing public recognition, undertook a thorough examination of gaps in 
pandemic preparedness related to mask usage. Their extensive effo rts led to detailed discussions 

PAGE 10:
with various stakeholders, from transport officials to leaders in educational institutions. The primary 
goal was to disseminate evidence -based knowledge on the effectiveness of masks, aiming to 
cultivate a widespread culture of mask advocacy and adherence.  
Amidst this backdrop of escalating influence, the NZ Masks4All chapter's trajectory was further 
invigorated by their collaboration with Jeremy Howard, a distinguished figure in the global Masks4All 
campaign. Howard, credited with significant advocacy miles tones, notably persuading US senators to 
publicly acknowledge the merits of masks in the pandemic's early phase, remained a steadfast 
collaborator. His co -authored research, "An evidence review of face masks against COVID -19" 
(Howard et al., 2021), substan tiated the empirical foundations of mask advocacy. Howard's 
sustained interactions with the NZ chapter over the pandemic's initial 18 months amplified their 
advocacy endeavours, coalescing to foreground the salience of mask -wearing during this tumultuous 
period.  
Theory Building:  
Central to the burgeoning success of the #Masks4All NZ group was its nature as a community of 
practice. Drawing from the seminal works of Lave & Wenger (1991) and Wenger (1998), such 
communities are grounded in the notion of shared learning and mutual enga gement. Here, 
individuals, driven by a common purpose, pool their expertise and experiences, fostering a collective 
learning environment. In the digital age, this takes on an amplified significance. The #Masks4All NZ 
group, through its virtual platform, tr anscended geographical barriers, converging a myriad of voices 
under a unified cause. Such a community, when orchestrated effectively, could not only disseminate 
knowledge but also become a force for tangible change.  
While the community of practice theory provided the structural architecture, the principles of 
collective intelligence added another layer of depth. Woolley et al. (2010) elucidated that when 
individuals collaborate, the group's collective intelligence oft en surpasses the sum of its parts. In the 
context of #Masks4All NZ, this meant harnessing the diverse expertise of its members – from 
healthcare professionals to passionate laypersons – to create an intelligence ecosystem that was 
dynamic, responsive, and above all, effective in its advocacy efforts.  
Yet, the task was not just about pooling collective intelligence but also about disseminating it 
effectively. Here, the insights from knowledge translation theory, particularly the works of Ian 
Graham, became invaluable. The goal was to transform empirical  findings on mask -wearing into 
actionable insights, tailored for the group's diverse demographic (Graham et al., 2006).  
Lastly, in an age where online communities are ubiquitous, understanding their unique dynamics 
was paramount. Scholars like Berger (2013) and Bandura (2009) have delved into how online 
platforms can mould interactions and engender specific behaviours. For the #Masks4All NZ 
community, this meant designing interventions that resonated with the unique affordances of online 
platforms, from the immediacy of feedback to the virality of shareable content.  
In summary, by fusing the principles of communities of practice, collective intelligence, knowledge 
translation, and online community dynamics, a robust theoretical foundation was established. This 
served as the bedrock upon which the #Masks4All NZ communi ty's advocacy efforts were 
conceptualised and executed.  
Systems Development:  
In the intricate landscape of digital communication, understanding the interplay between 
technological modalities and human discourse becomes imperative. The #Masks4All NZ initiative, 

PAGE 11:
primarily anchored within the structured environment of a Facebook group, exemplifies the efficacy 
of harnessing collective intellectual capacities within a community of practice, whilst adeptly 
navigating an array of digital platforms.  
The Facebook group, with its structured environment, emerged as the principal locus for 
engagement, providing a space for collaborative discourse where members could proactively engage 
in scholarly exchanges, elucidate empirical findings, and challenge extant misconceptions regarding 
mask utility.  
To augment the rich tapestry of engagement within the Facebook environment, several auxiliary 
digital instruments were judiciously integrated. Google Forms was employed to orchestrate 
structured data collection, meticulously capturing nuanced perspectives of the community. 
Advocacy efforts, underpinned by empirical evidence, were channelled through petitions hosted on 
Change.org, targeting policy -making entities to ensure the scholarly voice of the community 
reverberated within legislative corridors. Concur rently, the visual -centric medium of Instagram was 
utilised to propagate mask -making initiatives, aligning with the platform's predilection for visual 
dissemination.  
Throughout this developmental trajectory, strict adherence to the principles of knowledge 
translation was maintained (Graham et al., 2006). Content dissemination, irrespective of its digital 
medium, was meticulously calibrated to cater to the heterogeneous  demographic composition of 
the community. Thus, while academic and professional constituents were engaged through 
comprehensive scholarly syntheses, the wider community was apprised through lucid infographics 
and succinct academic narratives.  
In summation, the systems development phase exemplified a judicious amalgamation of 
technological infrastructures, theoretical paradigms, and the dynamics of online community 
engagement, thereby positioning the #Masks4All NZ community at the forefront of e rudite mask 
advocacy.  
Validation:  
To assess the efficacy of the #Masks4All NZ initiative, it was crucial to adopt an approach steeped in 
the principles of participatory validation, with the Facebook group acting as the nexus of this 
evaluative process. Given the inherent dynamics of online  communities of practice, validation could 
be immediate, transparent, and inclusive.  
Posts, infographics, and shared research within the group were not just static content; they became 
vibrant threads of discourse, evidenced by the flurry of likes, comments, and shares. Each comment, 
whether it affirmed or critiqued the shared content, act ed as a real -time feedback mechanism, 
harnessing the collective intelligence of the community. This immediate feedback, unique to online 
community dynamics, enabled the administrative team to rapidly refine the advocacy strategies, 
ensuring they remained r esonant with the community's ethos.  
Furthermore, periodic surveys, hosted within the group, provided structured avenues to gauge 
members' perceptions, concerns, and suggestions. These surveys, designed with the digital 
affordances of the Facebook platform in mind, ensured that every member, irrespective of their 
background, could voice their perspective. Thus, the validation process was not just an evaluative 
tool; it embodied the very principles of a community of practice, fostering shared learning and 
mutual engagement.  
Community Action:  

PAGE 12:
As the heart and soul of the #Masks4All NZ initiative, community action was underpinned by the 
principles of collective intelligence and online community dynamics. The Facebook group, acting as 
the central hub, played a pivotal role in channelling this col lective intelligence into coordinated 
advocacy efforts.  
Every member, by virtue of their participation in this digital community of practice, became not just 
a consumer of information but an active agent of change. Posts were designed, keeping in mind the 
unique affordances of social media, to be more than just  informative; they were crafted to be 
conversation starters. Each post, whether it shared the latest research or debunked prevalent mask 
myths, was tailored to spark discussions, tap into the collective intelligence of the group, and drive 
grassroots advoc acy. 
Harnessing the principles of social influence, members were encouraged to not just engage within 
the group but also to act as ambassadors outside its confines. By sharing key posts, creating and 
leveraging campaign -specific hashtags, and initiating mask -related challenges, members could 
extend the advocacy efforts to their personal networks. This digital ripple effect, where online 
engagements translated into real -world actions, was testament to the power of online community 
dynamics.  
Yet, the group's impact was not limited to the digital realm. Recognising the potential for offline 
impact, members were mobilised for tangible advocacy initiatives. Equipped with digital toolkits 
comprising infographics, research summaries, and persuasive  narratives, members engaged with 
local entities, from policymakers to community leaders, driving home the importance of universal 
masking. Collaborative drives with local businesses and institutions further amplified these efforts, 
ensuring that the group 's advocacy was felt in both digital and physical spaces.  
In essence, the #Masks4All NZ community action epitomised the transformative potential of online 
communities of practice. By seamlessly merging collective intelligence with the dynamism of online 
communities, it showcased how digital platforms can become p otent vehicles for real -world change.  
Outcome:  
The #Masks4All NZ community's influence and reach achieved a significant milestone, with the 
group amassing over 7,500 active members at its zenith. This remarkable growth attested to the 
community's resonant message and its proficiency in engaging a diver se audience. The dynamic and 
continuous exchanges that took place within the group further underscored its pivotal role in mask 
advocacy in New Zealand. Such pronounced engagement within an online community of practice 
showcased the transformative potentia l of digitally -mediated grassroots movements. Grounded in 
evidence -based knowledge and a distinct mission, platforms like #Masks4All NZ profoundly 
influenced public perceptions and behaviours surrounding critical public health initiatives, echoing 
Benkler' s insights on the transformative nature of participatory digital networks (Benkler, 2006).  
 
4. Navigating Public Health Challenges: Leveraging Communication and Collective Conformity 
for Impactful Outcomes.  
Observation:  
In the initial months of the COVID -19 pandemic, New Zealand, like many nations, faced the daunting 
task of ensuring public adherence to vital preventive measures. Based on the researcher's extensive 
observations during the early phase of the 2020 nationwid e lockdown, he noticed that a surprisingly 

PAGE 13:
low percentage of supermarket patrons wore face masks. After spending significant hours in 
supermarkets, gauging mask compliance, he estimated that less than 10% of visitors adopted this 
protective measure. This was concerning, especially given the burgeon ing global evidence 
highlighting the importance of masks in curbing virus transmission.  
Several factors could have contributed to this low adherence. The government's initial reserved 
approach towards promoting universal mask -wearing might have influenced public attitudes, 
causing hesitation. Additionally, societal misconceptions, fuelled by cognitive biases or 
misinformation, further exacerbated the issue. To the researcher, it became clear that a robust 
communication strategy was imperative. Such a strategy needed to do more than just inform; it 
needed to inspire and galvanise the public int o action, harnessing the impact of positive emotional 
framing and societal norms.  
The societal response to the pandemic was not merely a reflection of individual beliefs but was also 
deeply influenced by collective thought processes and prevailing social norms. It was evident that 
simply broadcasting the importance of preventive measure s wouldn't suffice. The approach had to 
be nuanced, tapping into the collective psyche, dispelling myths, and fostering an environment 
where adhering to preventive guidelines became the societal norm, not the exception.  
Theory Building:  
To architect an impactful communication strategy, it was imperative to delve deep into a multitude 
of theories spanning social psychology, behavioural sciences, and persuasion techniques. One 
foundational pillar was the prospect theory by Kahneman & Tversk y (1979). This theory elucidated 
the nuances of decision -making under uncertainty, suggesting that individuals are more receptive 
when behavio urs are framed as gainful actions. For instance, by portraying mask -wearing as a means 
of safeguarding oneself and  the community, rather than a burdensome obligation, public adherence 
might be bolstered.  
Merely employing positive framing would not be enough. During challenging times, especially when 
faced with a ubiquitous threat like a pandemic, invoking a sense of unity and community spirit 
becomes paramount. Here, Fredrickson's (2004) broaden -and-build theory offers invaluable insights. 
This theory posits that positive emotions can expand individuals' thought -action repertoires, 
prompting a wider range of constructive responses. In the context of the pandemic, by accentuating 
positive narratives —such as acts of kindness, resilience, and manifestations of community spirit —a 
public health  campaign might want to  aim to amplify these broadening effects. Such a strategy 
would not only inspire individuals to adopt protective measures like mask -wearing for their own 
safety but also foster a heightened sense of responsibility towards the collective well -being. As 
Fredrickson suggests, the positive emotions stemming from these narratives could build enduring 
personal and social resources, thereby strengthening community bonds and encouraging sustained 
adherence to health guidelines for the benefit of all.  
Cialdini's influential work on persuasion (2001) further enriched this theoretical tapestry. 
Recognising that individuals often seek validation and are influenced by societal norms, showcasing 
widespread mask adoption as the prevalent norm could gently nudge ( Thaler and Sunstein , 2008),  
individuals towards compliance. The role of societal influencers, underscored by Hovland & Weiss's 
(1951) research on authority influence, was equally pivotal. Collaborating with these influential 
figures could amplify the impact of any community health campaign the researcher embarked upon. 
With insights from these diverse theoretical realms, the researcher envisioned a comprehensive 

PAGE 14:
communication ethos. This ethos, rooted deeply in motivation, inspiration, and action, would aim to 
foster not just awareness but also a genuine commitment to community -wide health and well -being.  
Systems Development:  
In the face of the pandemic's pervasive uncertainty, the need to galvanise proactive public health 
behaviours was evident. This necessitated a multifaceted approach, rooted deeply in evidence and 
tailored to New Zealand's unique socio -cultural backdrop. Th e formation of the "Caring 4 Whanau" 
collective by the researcher, which notably ran a podcast during the initial lockdown, and the 
subsequent involvement with "Masks 4 All New Zealand" became pivotal initiatives.  
Though spearheaded by the researcher, these efforts were underpinned by significant support from 
his community -based allies. Professor Baker's collaboration, in particular, provided added credibility 
and expertise to the campaign.  
Central to the campaign's strategy was a comprehensive pitch deck. This detailed plan outlined a 
wide range of digital and traditional interventions, each conceptualised to serve as digital 
information kiosks. The pitch deck featured the establishment and promotion of Facebook pages, 
websites, Instagram channels, and YouTube videos. Additionally, it included shareable digital 
pamphlets on mask -making techniques, online petitions, and lobbying approaches tailored for 
politicians and other decision -makers. Ed itorials at the university further amplified the message, 
while strategically crafted TV and radio spots were integrated to ensure the campaign's message 
resonated across diverse demographic segments.  
The campaign was imbued with a spirit celebrating New Zealanders' sense of community. By framing 
health measures as collective acts of caring, the campaign sought to foster unity. Engaging with 
respected community figures further enriched the campaign. The ir involvement, grounded in the 
principles of authority and source credibility as outlined by Hovland & Weiss (1951), provided the 
campaign with authenticity.  
Building upon Cialdini's (2001) principles of social proof, the campaign prominently showcased 
testimonials and stories from individuals endorsing preventive measures. This strategy aimed to 
instil a sense of belonging and emphasise that health guideline a dherence was both a responsible 
and popular choice.  
By weaving these diverse elements together, the Systems Development phase birthed a robust, 
adaptive, and empathetic campaign. This campaign was poised to make a lasting impact on public 
health behaviours in New Zealand.  
Validation:  
For an initiative of such scale and importance, rigorous validation was paramount. It wasn't merely 
about ensuring the accuracy of the information disseminated but validating its resonance, relevance, 
and impact on diverse community subsets. The campaign's  content underwent rigorous reviews by a 
diverse group of experts spanning fields such as behaviour change (Bandura, 2001), health 
communication (Kreuter & Wray, 2003), and community engagement (Laverack, 2006). Their 
feedback was instrumental in refining the campaign's tone, ensuring it struck the right balance 
between informativeness and inspiration.  
Beyond expert consultations, the campaign sought validation from its most important stakeholder: 
the community. Representative focus groups, reflective of New Zealand's diverse demographic 
tapestry, were convened. These sessions, anchored in the principles  of participatory research and 

PAGE 15:
community engagement (Nelson & Prilleltensky, 2010), offered invaluable insights into the 
campaign's reception, helping identify areas of strength and potential refinement. The feedback 
loops were continuous, with the campaign evolving in real -time, inform ed by ground realities and 
community feedback.  
Moreover, the campaign's reach and impact were predominantly gauged through qualitative 
methods and media analysis frameworks (McQuail, 2010). Anecdotal feedback, community 
discussions, and engagement metrics like shares provided a nuanced picture of the c ampaign's 
resonance within the community. While some accomplished statisticians within the Masks4All group 
aided in discerning pandemic spread statistics, the approach largely leaned on qualitative insights 
and lived experiences. This nuanced approach ensu red that the campaign remained agile, 
responsive, and deeply attuned to the community's needs and sentiments. Through this rich, multi -
layered validation process, the campaign not only ensured its credibility but also fortified its place as 
a trusted sourc e of information and inspiration during these challenging times.  
Community Action:  
Central to the campaign's ethos was the belief that impactful change is amplified by grassroots, 
community -led initiatives, rather than solely by top -down directives. Recognising the power of 
community, a broad approach was taken to ensure deep penetration  of the campaign's messages 
across New Zealand's diverse communities.  
Respected community figures played a pivotal role, championing the campaign's ethos and serving 
as role models. Their endorsement, echoing Cialdini's principles of authority and social proof (2001), 
lent significant credibility to the campaign's messages.  
The digital landscape, especially social media, was harnessed extensively. Hyperlocal groups, online 
forums, and influencers were engaged, fostering organic dialogues around the campaign's core 
themes. These platforms transformed into vibrant hubs for shar ed responsibility and solidarity.  
To augment the campaign's reach, traditional media channels were not overlooked. Strategic radio 
and TV spots were curated, targeting varied demographics. Newspaper representations, tailored to 
the cultural nuances of different communities, further solidif ied the campaign's presence in the 
public domain.  
Collaborations with established community organisations further propelled the campaign. Through 
these partnerships, ground events and seminars were organised, ensuring comprehensive 
community outreach. By integrating principles of dynamic knowledge transla tion (Graham et al., 
2006), these activities translated the campaign's messages into actionable, locally -relevant 
initiatives.  
In essence, the Community Action phase exemplified the transformative power of collective effort. It 
illuminated how unified communities, driven by shared vision and purpose, can surmount even the 
direst challenges. Through a blend of digital engagement, t raditional media, and grassroots 
initiatives, the campaign became an emblem of hope and action amidst global adversity.  
Outcome:  
The campaign's impact was evident in the shifting public attitudes and heightened adoption of 
recommended health measures. As communities coalesced around the campaign's positive 
messages, there was a noticeable uptick in health -conscious behaviours like m ask-wearing and 
physical distancing. The campaign's triumph was not just in disseminating information but in 

PAGE 16:
touching hearts, translating individual motivations into collective actions. While precise 
quantification of health outcomes remains a future endeavour, initial observations hint at bolstered 
community resilience. The campaign underscored the potential of positive, community -centric 
communication. It served as a beacon, showing that research -backed, community -anchored 
interventions can indeed spark transformative movements. The Masks4All group, including the 
researcher, took immense pride in being part of t his transformative journey, shaping a more resilient 
and health -conscious New Zealand.  
5. Understanding Influences on Preventative Health Behaviors: An Academic Landscape 
Survey  
Observation:  
The COVID -19 pandemic unveiled several layers of complexity concerning public health measures in 
New Zealand. In particular, the inconsistent enforcement of mask mandates across different public 
spaces sparked intrigue. While certain areas with higher risk s like public transport and airplanes had 
clear mask mandates, other frequently populated areas like supermarkets and salons for the longest 
time left the decision to individuals. This lack of uniformity brought forth several questions. Why 
were individual s choosing not to wear masks in spaces where it wasn’t mandated? Were there 
external factors influencing these decisions? Or perhaps, were there gaps in the public's 
understanding of the importance of these preventative measures? The need to probe deeper i nto 
these behavioural intricacies was evident.  
As one delves deeper into the observational data, certain patterns and anomalies become evident. 
For instance, while some public spaces witnessed a surge in voluntary mask usage over time, others 
remained largely unaffected. This disparity in behavioural c hange over a similar timeframe pointed 
towards underlying factors that might be influencing these choices. Were people in certain locations 
more informed? Or perhaps, were there local influencers who played a pivotal role in shaping public 
opinion? Such ob servational nuances emphasized the need for a comprehensive academic 
exploration into the matter.  
Drawing inspiration from the foundations of academic research, the observations seemed to 
resonate with Nunamaker et al.’s (1991) problem awareness principle. The principle underlines the 
significance of not just observing and identifying problems but delv ing deeper to understand their 
root causes and seeking out timely and effective solutions. In the context of the pandemic, this 
meant not just observing behavioural trends but understanding the factors that led to these 
patterns. The observations laid the groundwork for a deeper academic exploration into the myriad 
factors influencing preventative health behaviours . 
Theory Building:  
To understand the underlying factors that shaped these behaviours, the researcher delved deeply 
into a range of social psychology theories. The Theory of Planned Behaviour, as delineated by Ajzen 
(1991), offers a foundational framework. This theory suggests that individual intentions and actions 
often arise from their attitudes towards the behaviour,  their perceived behavioural control, and the 
subjective norms around them. Through this lens, the researcher sought to decipher the variations 
in mask -wearing decisions, understanding the complex interplay of personal beliefs, societal 
pressures, and perc eived control.  
The Social Identity Theory (Tajfel, 1974) added another dimension, postulating that individuals often 
act according to the norms and beliefs of the group they identify with. This theory became 

PAGE 17:
instrumental in understanding the collective dynamics at play during the pandemic, particularly in 
relation to mask -wearing.  
To delve into the nuances of persuasion, the researcher referenced the elaboration likelihood model 
by Petty & Cacioppo (1986) and Cialdini's principles of influence (Cialdini, 2001). While the former 
speaks to how messages are processed, either centrally with much thought or peripherally with less 
deliberation, Cialdini's work provided insights into the tactics that can make certain messages more 
compelling, such as the use of authority figures or the principle of reciprocity.  
Lastly, drawing from behavioural economics, the researcher incorporated the insights of Thaler 
(2015), who highlighted the impact of 'nudges' in influencing public behaviour. By understanding 
how small prompts can lead to significant behavioural shifts, th e researcher aimed to design 
interventions that subtly guide individuals towards desired health behaviours, like wearing masks.  
However, while these seminal works provided invaluable theoretical foundations, they did not 
specifically address behavioural dynamics in crisis situations like a pandemic. Recognising this gap, 
the researcher contemplated the nuances unique to such unprec edented scenarios. There was an 
inherent curiosity about what academics, specifically working in this space, might elucidate 
regarding the individual and collective nuances that emerge during such crises.  
Systems Development:  
In response to the pandemic's intricate challenges, the Masks4All group, recognising the potential 
gaps in our understanding of health behaviours, proposed an innovative approach. We decided to 
create an informal survey targeting the academic community to gain a broader perspective on 
health behaviours, especially regarding mask -wearing. While rooted in the the oretical underpinnings 
of social psychology, the survey's design remained exploratory, intended to serve as a 
complementary tool to enhance our community -driven initiatives.  
For this endeavour, 60 academics were selected, hailing predominantly from New Zealand. These 
academics spanned various disciplines, including Marketing, Behavioural Economics, Social and 
Health Psychology, and Human Geography. Of these, 43 academics compl eted the survey.  
The survey was structured to investigate the multifaceted factors influencing mask -wearing 
behaviours. Drawing from the rich theoretical backdrop, questions were crafted to probe into 
personal beliefs, societal pressures, perceived behavioural control, as informed by the Theory of 
Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991). Additionally, the survey aimed to untangle the complexities of 
group dynamics in influencing individual decisions, informed by the Social Identity Theory (Tajfel, 
1974).  
In line with the elaboration likelihood model (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986), the survey also sought to 
discern the avenues through which individuals received and processed information about the 
pandemic, influencing their behavioural choices. Given its explorat ory nature, the survey underwent 
iterative refinements, incorporating feedback from both social psychology experts and community 
allies. The primary aim was to ensure that the survey, while being comprehensive, also resonated 
with the practical experiences  and challenges faced by the community, offering perspectives that 
might be overlooked in more conventional research methods.  
Validation:  
While the survey's design aimed to tap into the insights of an academic community, I, as the 
researcher, emphasised to our Masks4All group that the survey was exploratory and non -academic 

PAGE 18:
in its essence. I stressed that we should not view it as a traditional reliable or valid research 
instrument. Instead, it should be seen as an informal tool, offering anecdotal insights that might 
guide our strategies and interventions. This perspective, w hile underscoring the survey's limitations, 
did not diminish its value but rather set a realistic framework for its interpretation and application.  
The preliminary version of the survey was circulated among the selected group of academics. Their 
feedback, while not forming part of a traditional validation process, was invaluable, offering insights 
into potential gaps, ambiguities, and areas of focus. This feedback -oriented approach ensured clarity 
and relevance, aligning the survey with the objectives of our Masks4All group. The preliminary 
responses provided an initial glimpse into behavioural influencers, aiding our group in refining 
community -based strategies.  
This blend of academic respondents and an informal survey tool underscored our commitment to 
understanding the myriad factors influencing preventative health behaviours in New Zealand, 
positioning us to make informed decisions in our community -driven effor ts during the pandemic.  
Community Action:  
Armed with the insights from the survey, our approach within the Masks4All group experienced a 
nuanced evolution. The survey's findings, though anecdotal, provided us with a newfound 
confidence, enabling us to anchor our local activities within the broader  purview of health science. 
Anecdotally, this integration seemed to bolster our credibility, especially when engaging with family, 
friends, and the broader community.  
The feedback from the academic community shaped our digital campaigns across platforms like 
Facebook, YouTube, and podcasts. These platforms morphed into dynamic information hubs, 
fostering community dialogue and disseminating evidence -informed narratives.  
Our traditional media outreach – through radio, TV spots, and newspaper editorials – was enriched 
and amplified. These channels resonated with feedback and sentiments from the academic 
community, bolstering our outreach and impact.  
Endorsements from trusted community figures and influencers, underpinned by insights from the 
survey, synergised our efforts, leading to greater community acceptance and action. Our community 
interventions, both digital and on the ground, reached even the most remote areas of New Zealand.  
Reflecting on this phase of Community Action, the importance of collaboration, informed 
understanding, and evidence -backed action was evident. Being part of the Masks4All group, I felt 
immense pride in our journey – a testament to the power of community -led initiatives, informed by 
anecdotal insights, in fostering collective resilience and well -being during challenging times like the 
pandemic.  
Outcome:  
Upon incorporating academic insights into our Masks4All initiatives, tangible shifts were observed in 
the community's attitudes and behaviours. Our digital campaigns experienced heightened 
engagement, while our on -the-ground activities received increased r eceptivity. This mirrored the 
successful blending of informal academic feedback with practical community action. Furthermore, 
anecdotal feedback indicated richer, more informed discussions on mask -wearing within local 
communities. Such discussions frequent ly referenced the survey's findings, suggesting a growing 
recognition of its value. In essence, intertwining grassroots initiatives with academic perspectives 

PAGE 19:
fortified our group's efforts, making a pronounced impact during the challenging times of the 
pandemic.  
6. Applying Normative Influence Theory to Increase Mask Compliance  
Observation:  
The global onset of the COVID -19 pandemic catalysed unparalleled changes in public health 
directives and societal behaviours. One of the most pronounced shifts was the adoption of mask -
wearing as a preventative measure. Within the confines of the residential complex where the 
researcher resided, it was evident that residents' mask -wearing behaviours were inconsistent. Some 
conscientiously wore masks, recognising their ro le in mitigating virus transmission. Yet, a significant 
portion appeared indifferent, navigating common areas without masks. Conversations with these 
residents elucidated diverse reasons for their reluctance: some lamented the unavailability of masks 
in lo cal stores, others bemoaned their prohibitive costs, while a few simply expressed disdain for the 
perceived discomfort of wearing them. The gravity of such non -compliance was profound, especially 
given the elevated risks associated with enclosed communal s paces, where air circulation could 
potentially facilitate the virus's spread.  
Parallel to this, anecdotal reports from members of the Masks4All New Zealand group, dispersed 
throughout the country, sketched a varied tableau of mask -wearing behaviours among supermarket 
staff. Some supermarkets stood out as paragons of public health co mpliance, with almost every staff 
member donning a mask, resulting in compliance rates that approached a commendable 90%. Yet, in 
stark contrast, other outlets showcased a palpable laxity in adherence, with compliance rates 
plummeting to a worrying 30%. Su ch disparities, witnessed in ostensibly similar commercial 
environments, heightened the urgency for customised interventions that could address the 
underlying causes of such non -compliance. This patchwork of behaviours found echoes in Cialdini et 
al.’s (19 90) focus theory of normative conduct, highlighting the influential role of societal norms and 
peer behaviours in shaping individual decisions.  
Theory Building:  
Central to the approach was the focus theory of normative conduct (Cialdini et al., 1990). This theory 
elucidates that individuals often model their actions based on perceived norms within their social 
circles. If mask -wearing were championed as a normativ e behaviour, it could drive widespread 
adoption.  
Complementing this perspective is the Social Identity Theory by Tajfel and Turner (1979). This theory 
posits that individuals' behaviours are significantly influenced by the groups they affiliate with. 
Fishbein and Ajzen's (1975) Theory of Reasoned Action further expands on this, suggesting that 
individual behaviours are a culmination of intentions driven by attitudes towards the behaviour and 
subjective norms. By positioning mask -wearing as a group norm and aligning attitudes positively 
towards it, there's  a heightened likelihood of compliance (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975).  
Additionally, the Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, 1974) offers insights into individuals' decisions to 
adopt health -related behaviours, emphasising perceived threats and benefits. By understanding and 
leveraging these perceptions, interventions can be tai lored to emphasise the personal and 
communal benefits of mask -wearing, driving compliance (Rosenstock, 1974).  
Systems Development:  

PAGE 20:
With a sound theoretical foundation in place, the next step was to design tailored interventions. For 
the residential apartment building, an initiative was conceptualised that involved distributing 
reusable fabric masks to all residents. Accompanying each mask was an explanatory flyer detailing 
the objective behind the initiative – namely, to encourage mask usage in shared communal spaces. 
This was seen as a tangible step to ensure the safety and health of all residents. By providing the 
masks and coupling them with persuasive messaging, the goal was to trigger a critical mass of mask 
usage, ultimately reaching a tipping point where mask -wearing became the norm.  
On the supermarket front, the strategy was notably multifaceted. To ascertain compliance rates 
among both staff and shoppers, 'mystery shopping' visits were orchestrated. These discreet 
evaluations were conducted by members of the Masks4All New Zealand gro up. The researcher 
played a pivotal role in coordinating these efforts, ensuring that observations were systematically 
captured. Following these visits, regular online debriefing sessions were hosted by the researcher, 
where members discussed their observa tions and shared insights. These collective observations, 
which encompassed behaviours of both staff and shoppers, were then relayed to the corporate 
headquarters at regular intervals. The data collated provided management with a clear picture of 
the store s where compliance was not up to the mark. Armed with this invaluable information, 
targeted interventions could be rolled out. These ranged from issuing compliance reminders to store 
managers to launching retraining programmes that highlighted the importan ce of mask -wearing. By 
harnessing both top -down directives from management and the intrinsic power of peer influence, 
the overarching aim was to solidify mask -wearing as a habitual practice among both the 
supermarket staff and shoppers.  
Both interventions, though distinct in their settings, converged on a central theme: establishing a 
critical mass of mask -wearing. Drawing on Lewin's work on change processes and field theory 
(1947), the goal was to create conditions where mask -wearing wou ld transition from being a 
sporadic behaviour to an ingrained social norm. This shift in collective behaviour, akin to reaching a 
critical threshold or 'tipping point' as later popularised by Gladwell (2000), aimed to solidify mask -
wearing as a regular pra ctice. Additionally, the interventions drew inspiration from the nudge 
theory, which underscores the potential of subtly guiding individuals towards desired behaviours 
(Thaler & Sunstein, 2008).  
Validation:  
Post -implementation, the effectiveness of the interventions was gauged through various 
mechanisms. In the residential apartment setting, observational data served as the primary 
validation tool. In the weeks following the mask distribution, there was a dis cernible uptick in mask 
usage within communal areas. From an initial baseline of less than 10%, compliance surged to over 
70%, as per observational estimates. This was further corroborated through informal conversations 
with residents, with the majority ex pressing a positive sentiment towards the initiative.  
For the supermarket intervention, the validation process was extensive and collaborative. The 
Masks4All 'mystery shoppers' engaged in regular debriefing sessions after their visits. The researcher 
played a lead role in these debriefings, consolidating the findings from various members and 
ensuring a cohesive understanding of observations. Every few days, for a duration of approximately 
six weeks, these consolidated findings were reported to the senior management of the supermarket 
chain, specifically those in charge of Covid health compliance. This real -time feedback loop allowed 
senior management to swiftly identify compliance challenges in specific stores and implement 
corrective measures. Feedback from store managers was also solicited, offering a granula r view of 
the intervention's impact at the store level.  

PAGE 21:
While both interventions yielded positive preliminary results, there were acknowledged limitations. 
The reliance on observational and anecdotal evidence, in the absence of more rigorous validation 
tools like surveys or third -party evaluations, meant that t he findings, though promising, required 
further validation. Future iterations could benefit from incorporating more systematic validation 
methods to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the interventions' efficacy.  
Community Action:  
The interventions embarked upon were not just mechanistic strategies to promote mask -wearing; 
they were deeply rooted in fostering community solidarity and responsibility during an unparalleled 
health crisis.  
Within the residential complex, the distribution of masks was accompanied by detailed flyers that 
did more than merely instruct. They narrated a narrative of mutual benefit, urging residents to view 
mask -wearing not just as a personal protective measure bu t as a collective commitment to the 
community's safety. This sentiment was further amplified through strategically placed notices in 
shared spaces like lobbies and lifts, regularly reminding residents of their collective role and 
responsibility in combatti ng the spread of the virus.  
The supermarket strategy was more intricate, reflective of the broader public it catered to. Beyond 
the top -down directives from management that emphasised mask -wearing, the real strength lay in 
the grassroots efforts of the Masks4All members. Their role a s 'mystery shoppers' was pivotal, as 
they spent endless hours observing, documenting, and analysing compliance in various supermarket 
outlets. Their commitment to the cause was evident not just in their rigorous evaluations but also in 
their sustained effo rts beyond the formal observation period. Even after the 6 -week project 
concluded, several dedicated members of Masks4All persisted in their monitoring efforts. They 
continued to engage with local store managers, fostering a collaborative approach to impro ving 
mask compliance. This ongoing dialogue ensured that the momentum gained during the formal 
intervention was not lost. Instead, it facilitated an environment where mask -wearing became less 
about organisational directives and more about community -led act ion. Through these concerted 
efforts, mask -wearing was positioned not just as a transient response to a pandemic but as a long -
term commitment to community well -being.  
Outcome:  
The preliminary outcomes of both interventions were encouraging. Observational data from the 
residential setting indicated a significant uptick in mask -wearing post -intervention. In supermarkets, 
compliance improved markedly, with some stores even nearing optimal adherence levels. While the 
Masks4All mystery project cannot claim full credit for these improvements, individual members felt 
that their sustained efforts and engagements with store managers were not in vain, making a 
tangible difference in the la rger campaign. However, these positive shifts, rooted in observational 
and anecdotal feedback, underline the need for more rigorous, future evaluations.  
 
7. Enhancing Safety of Close Contact Services Through Stakeholder Collaboration  
Observation:  
In the intricate landscape of New Zealand's response to the COVID -19 pandemic, the methodical 
reopening of various sectors ushered in a host of challenges. The beauty industry, encapsulating 
services such as hairdressing, nail salons, spas, and make -up studios, was particularly fraught with 

PAGE 22:
dilemmas. The very nature of these services demands close physical interactions between providers 
and clients, thereby amplifying the urgency for meticulous safety protocols. Delving into various 
digital platforms, which act as barometers of prevailing pub lic sentiment, revealed a tapestry of 
concerns voiced by both customers and those entrenched in the industry. These platforms, beyond 
our Masks4All group, included myriad online forums engaging in fervent debates regarding the 
challenges faced by the beaut y sector. Such forums, serving as microcosms of broader societal 
apprehensions, underscored a prevalent anxiety about ensuring health and safety as services sought 
to recommence. The synthesis of these digital narratives highlighted an urgent imperative: t he 
establishment of evidence -backed, practicable guidelines tailored to the unique contours of the 
beauty industry.  
This burgeoning digital narrative elucidated a conspicuous void: the dire need for cogent, empirically 
underpinned guidelines to allay these proliferating apprehensions. Recognising the gravity of the 
scenario was paramount. Given the beauty sector's integral role as a substantial economic 
contributor and its significance as a primary livelihood source for myriad individuals, its secure 
operational resumption was of paramount importance. The conundrum was multifaceted: it 
necessitated not only the synthesis of comprehensive guidelines but also the assur ance that these 
directives would be both pragmatic and efficacious, thus fostering an environment of trust and 
assurance amongst all involved parties.  
Further analysis of digital discussions and qualitative data highlighted a clear concern, echoing the 
problem awareness principle as outlined by Nunamaker et al. (1991). It was evident that the beauty 
industry, in preparation for resumption of operations, required well -designed interventions 
grounded in empirical research, yet adapted to the specific needs of the sector. Within the 
Masks4All community, particular attention was given to this sector, notably with the inclusion of 
some members who were promine nt leaders within the beauty industry. Their contributions further 
emphasised the need for a collaborative approach, integrating scientific knowledge with practical 
industry considerations  
Theory Building:  
Addressing the challenges identified in the observation stage required a theoretical foundation that 
integrated rigorous academic principles with tangible real -world applicability. The Masks4All group, 
having established itself as a credible entity in publ ic health advocacy, was poised to play a pivotal 
role in this juncture. With its members encompassing both general public advocates and esteemed 
leaders within the beauty industry, the group's expertise and credibility offered a unique advantage 
in bridgin g the knowledge gap and augmenting the industry's efforts to navigate the complexities of 
the pandemic.  
The concept of trust, as delineated by Kelton et al. (2008), emerged as a core theoretical tenet. 
Given the profound uncertainties of the pandemic era, fostering trust in the guidelines and 
recommendations became paramount. The beauty industry, faced with the imperative of ensuring 
health safety while resuming operations, would benefit immensely from the credibility and expertise 
offered by Masks4All.  
Supplementing this was the collaborative governance model articulated by Ansell and Gash (2008). 
The model underscores the value of collaborative efforts between diverse stakeholders to achieve 
cohesive outcomes. In the context of the beauty industry, it n ecessitated a collaborative synthesis of 
insights from health experts, industry leaders, and the Masks4All community. Such an approach 

PAGE 23:
aimed to produce guidelines steeped in empirical evidence while being nuanced for the specific 
requirements of the beauty sector.  
The integration of these theories provided a comprehensive blueprint for action. The primary 
objective was to establish a milieu underpinned by open communication, mutual respect, and trust. 
By actively involving Masks4All, with its accumulated expertise a nd industry connections, in the 
process of guideline formulation, the strategy sought to ensure that the ensuing guidelines would 
not only be rooted in scientific rigour but also practical and implementable. This spirit of inclusivity 
and collaboration res onated with the tenets of participatory action research, which emphasises the 
proactive involvement of all stakeholders in problem -solving processes (Lewin, 1946; Nelson & 
Prilleltensky, 2010).  
Systems Development:  
In advancing the strategies and insights gleaned from the observation and theoretical foundation 
stages, the emphasis transitioned to operationalising this knowledge. The Masks4All group, fortified 
by its established credibility in the realm of public heal th advocacy, proactively reached out to 
industry stakeholders. A methodologically structured communication was conveyed to these 
stakeholders, delineating the tangible risks associated with reinstating close -contact services in the 
beauty sector amidst the  pandemic's backdrop. Crucially, this outreach was underscored by a 
collaborative proposition: leveraging the Masks4All group's consolidated expertise, particularly that 
of the researcher and his collaborations with prominent figures like Professor Baker, to assist the 
industry in adeptly circumnavigating these challenges.  
To further augment the credibility and potency of this outreach, the collaboration with Professor 
Baker, a preeminent epidemiologist in New Zealand, was prominently spotlighted. Harnessing his 
stature and the trust he had cultivated during the pandemic pro vided an additional layer of 
assurance to industry stakeholders, fostering an environment conducive for active engagement and 
collaboration.  
The systems development phase epitomised the ethos of collaborative synergy. The objective was 
dual -faceted: to amalgamate scientific acumen with the practical operational dynamics of the beauty 
sector. Drawing upon organizational development principles, a s elucidated by Schein (1996), this 
initiative endeavoured to coalesce expertise from diverse quarters to sculpt guidelines that 
resonated with scientific integrity and operational pragmatism.  
Within this collaborative matrix, the Masks4All group, and particularly the researcher, took on a 
pivotal role. Given the researcher's established rapport with Hair & Barber New Zealand (H&BNZ, 
formerly NZARH), this association was instrumental in sculptin g a section within the health and 
safety plan, explicitly focused on mask usage. This integration was not merely symbolic; it signified 
the culmination of collaborative efforts, synthesising scientific research with industry -specific 
nuances to curate guid elines that were both empirically robust and practically implementable.  
Validation:  
To authenticate the feasibility and applicability of the collaborative approach, engagements with 
pivotal industry stakeholders were initiated. A primary contact was the Chairperson of the New 
Zealand Registered Hairdressers Association (NZARH). An exhaust ive meeting request was 
dispatched to the NZARH, elucidating the potential health risks associated with the reopening of 
salons during the pandemic's ongoing threat.  

PAGE 24:
The prompt affirmation from the NZARH Chairperson to participate in the proposed meeting was a 
significant indicator. This swift response not only indicated the industry's acute awareness of the 
present challenges but also their commitment to a collective strategy for mitigation. The validation 
process, informed by principles from community psychology (Nelson & Prilleltensky, 2010), sought 
feedback from industry participants. The aim was to ensure that the resultant guidelines were 
contextually tailored and  possessed actionable clarity.  
A salient milestone in the validation process was the recognition of the NZARH's health and safety 
plan during a Ministry of Health Press Conference. It was spotlighted and lauded as a model, 
delineating how close -contact sectors should contemplate their r eopening strategy amidst the 
pandemic. This accolade underscored the success of the collaborative efforts and heightened the 
credibility and acceptance of the guidelines among industry stakeholders, thereby fostering 
increased adherence and implementation.  
Community Action:  
Upon validation, the collaborative framework was mobilised. A series of virtual consultations was 
convened, amalgamating insights from New Zealand's preeminent epidemiologist and the NZARH 
Chairperson. These dialogues were centred on synergising scientific  health principles with the 
operational dynamics of the beauty industry.  
The collaborative consultations culminated in a comprehensive set of guidelines. Recognising the 
exigency of the situation, these directives were swiftly disseminated across New Zealand's hair 
salons, leveraging NZARH's extensive network. The iterative dev elopment process, augmented with 
regular feedback, ensured that the guidelines were not merely top -down edicts but were informed 
by ground -level insights.  
The community action phase epitomised collaborative ethos. With the validated guidelines in place, 
a series of training webinars and workshops were proposed to further familiarise industry 
professionals with the new protocols. These sessions aimed at not o nly disseminating the guidelines 
but also at addressing concerns, clarifying ambiguities, and ensuring that salons were well -equipped 
to implement the new protocols effectively. Stakeholder feedback loops were established, allowing 
for real -time feedback a nd potential refinements to the guidelines based on on -ground experiences.  
Central to this was the strategic application of normative and social influence principles, tailored to 
the unique context of the beauty industry. The initiative aimed to foster a sense of shared 
responsibility, seeking to accelerate the adoption of safety  protocols across the beauty sector. 
Collaborative efforts were also channelled into public awareness campaigns, ensuring that 
customers were cognisant of the measures in place and could make informed decisions when 
seeking beauty services.  
 
Outcome:  
The collaborative efforts culminated in the creation of robust guidelines tailored for the beauty 
industry's unique requirements, which gained widespread adoption across New Zealand. The public 
endorsement of the NZARH's health and safety plan during a Min istry of Health Press Conference 
amplified its credibility and acceptance. Coupled with proactive training initiatives, regular feedback 
mechanisms, and public awareness campaigns, the beauty industry was well -equipped to ensure 
health and safety amidst th e pandemic's challenges, demonstrating a remarkable blend of scientific 
acumen and industry -specific pragmatism.

8. Enhancing Pandemic Response through Comprehensive Cross -Sector Collaborations  
Observation:  
In the backdrop of New Zealand's evolving stance during the COVID -19 pandemic, the Masks4All 
group, having already carved a niche for itself through grassroots advocacy, sought to pinpoint and 
address areas where policy measures appeared to falter in the f ace of burgeoning scientific 
evidence. The collective's direct community engagements bore witness to a disconcerting trend: 
despite the mounting empirical support for mask usage, public transit settings like buses and trains 
remained conspicuous zones of n on-compliance.  
Revisiting their prior endeavours revealed an enlightening pattern. The collective’s conscientious 
attempts to inculcate mask -wearing habits within specific residential communities, although 
effective in microcosms, underscored a larger challenge: the real  hurdle was not isolated 
behavioural change, but the harmonisation of such changes at a national scale. The disparity 
between localised achievements and nationwide inconsistencies hinted at a broader systemic 
misalignment. It became evident that to effectu ate a pan -national behavioural shift, a more 
integrated approach was imperative, fusing policy directives with grassroots advocacy.  
Given the heightened credibility and extensive partnerships the Masks4All team had cultivated, they 
were uniquely poised to spearhead this integrated initiative. Their meticulously curated body of 
community -based research and intervention outcomes not only  spotlighted the extant gaps but also 
underscored the efficacy and impact of collaborative, community -driven interventions. This robust 
empirical foundation offered a compelling narrative, underscoring the need for weaving together 
expertise from various d omains – be it public health, policy formulation, or community advocacy – 
into a coherent, synergised pandemic response strategy.  
Theory Building:  
The strategy's foundation drew heavily from Rogers' (2003) Diffusion of Innovations theory, 
highlighting the essential role of communication channels and social systems in advancing the 
adoption of new behaviours such as mask -wearing. This theory elucidates how innovations spread 
through populations, underscoring the importance of early adopters and influential nodes within 
social networks.  
Furthermore, the Social Network Theory (Christakis & Fowler, 2007) provided valuable insights into 
the dynamics of human interconnectivity. By understanding the patterns and influences within these 
networks, it becomes feasible to identify key nodes or ind ividuals that can be leveraged to amplify 
the spread of mask -wearing norms and behaviours.  
The Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1985) was also integrated into the strategy. This theory 
posits that individuals' behaviours are shaped by their attitudes, perceived social norms, and their 
perceived control over the behaviour. By understanding and  influencing these components, one can 
foster environments that are more conducive to behavioural change.  
Lastly, the Agenda -Setting Theory (McCombs & Shaw, 1972) informed the approach towards media 
engagement. This theory emphasises the media's ability to influence the importance placed on 
certain topics within the public agenda. With this in mind, the strate gy sought to ensure that mask -
wearing and its associated benefits remained a salient topic in media discourse.  

PAGE 26:
Synthesising these theoretical frameworks, a comprehensive strategy emerged. The Masks4All 
group, with its robust ties to health professionals and its accrued credibility, sought to foster a 
dialogue that seamlessly integrated grassroots advocacy with top -tier policy recommendations. The 
media's role, fortified by the insights from the group's community endeavours, was instrumental in 
keeping the discourse on mask -wearing policies both prevalent and informed.  
Systems Development:  
Informed by their in -depth observations and the theoretical constructs, the Masks4All group pivoted 
towards a more holistic systems development approach, weaving together various strands of 
expertise and influence.  
Recognising the profound importance of robust scientific insights in driving public health policies, 
the group established early dialogues with leading epidemiologists. These interactions were 
instrumental in distilling and synthesising the burgeoning body  of research on mask efficacy into 
tangible, actionable insights. By doing so, the collective sought to ensure that any advocacy or policy 
recommendations were grounded firmly in empirical evidence.  
Given the group's accrued credibility, they found themselves in a unique position to act as conduits 
between the scientific community, policymakers, and key stakeholders in the transport sector. Initial 
engagements were set up with policymakers, heads of A uckland Transport, Wellington Metlink, and 
senior representatives from Air New Zealand. These structured dialogues presented these 
stakeholders with a meticulously curated amalgamation of scientific insights and community 
observations. The aim was to creat e an informed consensus, bridging the gaps between scientific 
recommendations, policy directives, and on -ground operational realities in the transport sector.  
Parallelly, the media's role in shaping public perception and influencing policy discourse was 
capitalised upon. Armed with community -based data, investigative journalists were engaged to 
spotlight the evident discrepancies between prevailing public health  policies, transport practices, 
and the emerging scientific consensus. Their narratives, informed by Masks4All's grassroots data, 
lent weight to the call for a more harmonised and evidence -driven approach in both policy and 
transport operations.  
Moreover, recognising the pivotal role of communities in driving behavioural change, the group 
collaborated with local community leaders and advocates to amplify the mask -wearing narrative at 
the grassroots level. These endeavours sought to foster an envir onment where mask -wearing was 
not just seen as a top -down directive but as a community -driven initiative, underpinned by both 
scientific rationale and a collective commitment to public health.  
Thus, the systems development phase was emblematic of Masks4All's commitment to a multi -
pronged and integrative approach. By synchronising top -down policy advocacy with bottom -up 
community initiatives, and ensuring that both were informed by the latest sci entific insights, the 
group aimed to sculpt a comprehensive, cohesive, and sustainable pandemic response strategy.  
Validation : 
The process of evaluating the influence and success of the collaborative strategies necessitated a 
nuanced and multi -faceted approach. With a particular emphasis on the transport sector, 
monitoring of policy shifts in entities like Auckland Transport, Well ington Metlink, and Air New 
Zealand was paramount. In a significant move, Auckland Transport swiftly instituted mandatory 
mask guidelines, an initiative that was promptly echoed by Air New Zealand in its domestic 
operations.  

PAGE 27:
In a bid to gain a more tangible grasp of the on -the-ground impacts of these policy changes, an 
informal observational approach reminiscent of the 'mystery shopper' technique previously 
employed in supermarkets was adopted across major transit hubs. This m ethod aimed to 
unobtrusively gauge real -world compliance to the new mask -wearing directives. The results were 
telling, with a discernible increase in mask -wearing compliance post the introduction of these 
policies, reinforcing the efficacy of such collabor ative efforts.  
The media's influence in shaping public perceptions was another critical facet of the validation 
process. An in -depth analysis of mask -centric narratives across diverse media platforms, from 
television broadcasts to digital channels, revealed a heightened emphasis on the importance of 
mask -wearing. While collaborations like those with Masks4All might have played a part, it was 
evident that a broader narrative shift was taking place in the media, attesting to the power of 
informed journalism in driving publi c discourse.  
To further refine the understanding of community sentiments, a qualitative study was conducted. 
This exercise shed light on a heartening shift in perceptions, with communities now viewing mask -
wearing more as a collective duty than a mere individual choice . 
Overall, the validation phase underscored the tangible benefits of a harmonised approach, aligning 
policies, media narratives, and ground realities through effective cross -sector collaborations.  
Community Action : 
While policy alignment was a significant milestone, the Masks4All collective was acutely aware that 
sustaining such gains necessitated ongoing community engagement. Drawing upon the Potential for 
Collective Action theory (Marwell et al., 1988), the group endeavoured to ensure that mask -wearing 
evolved from a mere policy directive to becoming a deeply rooted societal norm.  
In pursuit of this objective, Masks4All amplified its grassroots initiatives. Notable among these were 
high -visibility mask distribution drives at pivotal transit hubs. Concurrently, media campaigns were 
orchestrated, showcasing notable influencers and lea ders from diverse sectors exhibiting 
responsible mask -wearing behaviours. These endeavours were crafted with the intent to normalise 
mask -wearing, transitioning its perception from an external imposition to a universally endorsed 
practice.  
Beyond this, Masks4All sought collaborations with local educational and community organisations. 
These collaborations facilitated the roll -out of tailored educational campaigns, meticulously 
designed to debunk prevalent myths surrounding mask usage. Drawin g from the rich tapestry of 
insights accrued from their past engagements, these campaigns were tailored to be culturally 
resonant and contextually apt.  
The emphasis was unequivocally on cultivating a culture of collective responsibility. The goal was to 
move beyond the narrative of mask -wearing as a top -down mandate and embed it as a community -
driven ethic. Through their expansive partnerships and grassro ots networks, Masks4All was 
committed to maintaining and bolstering public advocacy around mask -wearing. This was envisioned 
as a means to ensure its continuity as a societal norm and a community -led movement, even as the 
broader policy terrain continued t o evolve.  
 
 
Outcome:  

PAGE 28:
The comprehensive and integrative strategies adopted by Masks4All underscored the power of 
cross -sector collaborations in effectuating meaningful change. By harmonising top -down policy 
directives with grassroots advocacy, and ensuring that such efforts wer e underpinned by rigorous 
scientific insights, tangible strides were made in addressing the pressing challenge of mask 
compliance in public transit settings. Moreover, the strategic engagements with key transport 
stakeholders like Auckland Transport, Welli ngton Metlink, and Air New Zealand illuminated the value 
of informed consensus -building. While the collective's efforts were instrumental, the broader 
societal shift towards mask -wearing was a testament to the combined influences of informed media 
narrativ es, robust community engagements, and responsive policy shifts. In essence, this iteration 
epitomised the philosophy that while individual efforts can sow the seeds of change, it is through 
collective, synergistic actions that sustainable transformations a re truly realised. References:

9. Fostering Global Solidarity: An In -Depth Exploration into Securing Essential PPE Supplies 
for Pacific Island Nations  
Observation:  
The relentless advance of COVID -19 drew sharp focus to the vulnerabilities of certain global regions, 
with Pacific Island nations emerging as a particular area of concern. Initial engagements, especially in 
Pacific communities such as Mangere, painted a gr im picture. The scarcity of protective gear, notably 
reusable masks, was palpable. The clarion call from advocacy networks, especially #mask4all, 
underscored the urgency. The researcher's South Korean affiliations serendipitously positioned him 
as a bridge  between New Zealand's leading epidemiologists and potential solutions. The burning 
question: Could the New Zealand government feasibly equip every citizen with a reusable mask? 
(Nunamaker et al., 1991; Kahneman, 2011).  
The urgency and magnitude of the issue necessitated immediate action. Observations revealed that 
while global powers grappled with the pandemic, regions like the Pacific Islands faced exacerbated 
challenges due to their unique geographical and socioeconomi c fabric. The lack of essential 
protective gear was a stark reminder of the pressing need for intervention. The vocal advocacy of 
the #mask4all network underscored the broader Pacific regions' vulnerabilities and the glaring gaps 
in preparedness.  
The researcher's affiliations with South Korea became an unexpected beacon of hope. New 
Zealand's leading epidemiologists, cognizant of this connection, reached out, exploring the feasibility 
of a nationwide mask provision initiative. This development unde rscored the potential for cross -
border collaboration and knowledge exchange to address the pressing challenges posed by the 
pandemic.  
Theory Building:  

PAGE 29:
Crafting a solution required a robust theoretical foundation. The Diffusion of Innovations theory by 
Rogers (2003) provided invaluable insights. It illuminated pathways for diffusing innovative solutions 
across geographically dispersed and culturally diver se communities. However, the challenge wasn't 
merely logistical or technical; it was deeply ethical. Principles of global justice, as articulated by 
Pogge (2008), highlighted the ethical imperative of ensuring equitable access to healthcare 
resources acros s the globe.  
The quest to foster mask -wearing compliance was complex, necessitating a multidimensional 
approach. Drawing inspiration from the Diffusion of Innovations theory, there was an emphasis on 
understanding how best to introduce and propagate the mask -wearing no rm across diverse Pacific 
communities. Furthermore, the ethical dimensions of the challenge were underscored by principles 
of global justice. This highlighted the moral duty to ensure equitable access to essential health 
resources, positioning it as a univ ersal right rather than a privilege.  
Integrating these perspectives, the researcher's approach was further enriched by insights from 
international development paradigms (Krätke & Byiers, 2014). These models emphasized a multi -
pronged strategy, blending rigorous assessment, fostering internati onal alliances, and most crucially, 
empowering local communities to take ownership of the interventions. This holistic approach aimed 
to ensure sustained benefits and resilience in the face of future challenges.  
Systems Development:  
The quest for solutions led to the discovery of the International Youth Culture Exchange Federation 
(IYCEF) based in South Korea. Their philanthropic initiative, the "Be Thoughtful" donation project, 
resonated deeply with the researcher's objectives. Recog nising the potential synergy, a 
comprehensive strategy, anchored in network theory (Senge, 1990) and change management 
paradigms (Lewin, 1946), was formulated. The goal: to harness global networks and foster capacity 
building at the grassroots level.  
The alliance with IYCEF offered a glimmer of hope. Their "Be Thoughtful" donation project, with its 
philanthropic ethos, aligned seamlessly with the researcher's mission. Recognising the inherent 
synergies, a multifaceted collaboration was envisaged. Drawi ng upon network theory and change 
management principles, a strategy was developed to maximise the impact of this partnership. The 
objective was clear: to utilise global networks effectively while strengthening the recipient 
communities, ensuring they were better prepared to navigate future crises.  
Collaborative endeavours took shape. The researcher's strategy centred on leveraging the expansive 
reach and resources of IYCEF while ensuring that the interventions were tailor -made for Pacific 
communities. Integrating principles from network theory and c hange management, the initiatives 
were designed to not just address immediate needs but to lay the groundwork for sustained 
resilience and self -sufficiency. The essence was to strike a balance between providing immediate 
relief and fostering long -term comm unity empowerment.  
Validation:  
As interventions unfolded, ensuring their contextual relevance was paramount. Pacific Island health 
officials, community leaders, and other pivotal stakeholders were extensively consulted. These 
consultations facilitated the establishment of iterative feed back loops, enabling ongoing strategy 
refinement. This commitment to continuous feedback and adaptation ensured the interventions 
remained attuned to the unique needs and aspirations of each Pacific community (Nelson & 
Prilleltensky, 2010).  

PAGE 30:
Validation wasn't a one -off phase but a continuous, iterative process. Pacific Island health officials, 
community torchbearers, and other stakeholders became integral collaborators, offering invaluable 
feedback and insights. This collaborative approach ensured the strategies evolved in real -time, 
always aligning with the unique nuances and needs of the communities. The emphasis was on co -
creation, ensuring the solutions were not just for the communities but crafted with them.  
The validation efforts underscored the commitment to ensuring the interventions resonated deeply 
with the target communities. The rich dialogues and consultations with Pacific Island stakeholders 
illuminated the path forward, enabling the fine -tuning of st rategies based on granular, on -the-
ground insights. The approach was holistic, weaving together expert perspectives, community 
voices, and real -world observations to ensure the initiatives were impactful and culturally sensitive.  
Community Action:  
Buoyed by the initial successes, the scope of the initiative expanded. Pacific nations like Tokelau and 
the Cook Islands became focal points of intervention. A slew of proactive engagements was rolled 
out, encompassing consultation sessions, knowledge diss emination forums, and community -centric 
events. The initiative's resonance was amplified in the broader media landscape, with notable 
features on radio stations and television networks. A poignant narrative spotlighting the dedication 
of the researcher and  the 'Caring 4 Whanau' group aired during a prime -time news slot, 
encapsulating the heart and spirit of the initiative (Cialdini, 2001).  
The ripple effects of the initiative were palpable. The burgeoning momentum catalysed an expansion 
of the project's scope, encompassing Pacific nations like Tokelau and the Cook Islands. With a 
broader canvas to work on, a series of community engagements w ere meticulously curated. From 
immersive consultation sessions to knowledge dissemination workshops, the emphasis was on 
fostering community ownership. The efforts captured media attention, culminating in a touching 
feature during prime -time news, highligh ting the relentless commitment of the researcher and the 
'Caring 4 Whanau' group.  
The community -centric approach underpinned every facet of the initiative. From engaging with 
Pacific nations to crafting interventions that resonated with local contexts, the emphasis was on 
empowering communities. The broader impact of these efforts trans cended the tangible outcomes. 
The media landscape took note, and the initiative's ethos and successes found voice through radio, 
television, and print. The community's stories, their challenges, and the transformative journey they 
embarked upon with the re searcher and 'Caring 4 Whanau' group became a beacon of hope, 
inspiration, and global solidarity.  
Reflecting on Outcomes:  
The tangible results of the interventions were promising. Pacific Island nations, once grappling with a 
dire shortage of PPE, found themselves better equipped to navigate the pandemic's challenges. 
Beyond the numbers, however, lay a narrative of global camaraderie and collaboration. The journey 
underscored the potential of collective action, illuminating pathways for fostering global solidarity in 
the face of shared challenges.  
The interventions yielded palpable outcomes. Pacific Island communities, once on the brink of a 
health catastrophe, witnessed a transformative shift in their preparedness. The tangible benefits, 
however, were merely a facet of the broader narrative. At its  core, the journey was a testament to 
the power of global collaboration, empathy, and shared purpose.  

PAGE 31:
Evaluating the outcomes, the successes were evident. Pacific Island nations, once vulnerable, were 
now better positioned to face the pandemic's challenges. However, the journey's true essence lay in 
the stories of collaboration, compassion, and community e mpowerment. It was a tale of global 
solidarity, of diverse stakeholders uniting with a shared vision, illuminating the path for future 
collaborations and interventions.
