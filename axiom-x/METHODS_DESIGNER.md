# Methods_Designer - Research Methodology
# =====================================

## Mission
Design the methodology section (400 words) that clearly explains how CKICAS theory translates to empirical validation through Axiom-X case study and Pacific project evidence.

## Section Structure
1. **Research Design Overview (100 words)**: Mixed-methods approach
2. **Axiom-X Case Study (150 words)**: 6-month validation protocol
3. **Pacific Project Validation (100 words)**: External recognition evidence
4. **Data Analysis Strategy (50 words)**: Validation methods

## Validation Strategy
- **Theoretical Predictions**: Translate CKICAS propositions to testable hypotheses
- **Axiom-X Metrics**: System telemetry demonstrating fractal properties
- **Pacific Evidence**: Government recognition + expert endorsements
- **Triangulation**: Multiple validation sources for robustness

## Empirical Rigor Requirements
- **Systematic Data Collection**: 6-month continuous monitoring
- **Quantifiable Metrics**: Adaptation efficiency, governance interventions
- **External Validation**: Independent recognition from governments/experts
- **Verifiability**: Anonymous experts can be verified by reviewers

## Integration Requirements
- **Upstream**: Must show how theory translates to empirical tests
- **Downstream**: Must support results section findings
- **Cohesion**: Connect theoretical formalization to measurable outcomes

## Success Criteria
- Methodology addresses empirical validation gaps identified by reviewers
- Pacific project evidence properly positioned as complementary validation
- Clear link between theory and measurement

## Status
- **Current Task**: Planning validation methodology
- **Word Count Target**: 400 words
- **Quality Checks**: Pending
- **Reviewer Concerns**: Must resolve empirical validation deficiencies</content>
