# 🚀 AXIOM-X INSTANT DEPLOYMENT PROMPT
## Fresh IDE → Fully Online in Under 30 Seconds

### The One-Shot Prompt for Fresh IDE:

```
Deploy the complete AXIOM-X autonomous learning system with full infrastructure, worker coordination, and optimization. Execute ultra-streamlined deployment with zero-failure automation, including Docker containers, API orchestration, fractal worker armies, LOG3/LOG4 analysis, Bellman optimization, and comprehensive smoke testing. All API keys are in .env file.
```

---

## 🎯 What This Achieves in <30 Seconds:

### Phase 1: Intelligent Pre-flight ✅
- Validates environment, API keys, Docker status
- Checks Python dependencies and system resources
- Verifies workspace structure and .env configuration

### Phase 2: Optimized Environment Setup ✅
- Creates virtual environment with optimized dependencies
- Installs scientific computing packages (numpy, scipy)
- Configures infrastructure directories and permissions

### Phase 3: Accelerated Container Build ✅
- Parallel Docker container builds (sidecar, orchestrator, agents)
- Fixed build contexts and dependency management
- Health check validation for all services

### Phase 4: Service Orchestration ✅
- Launches sidecar-router on port 8765
- Starts orchestrator-core on port 8080
- Deploys agent-swarm with 4 replicas

### Phase 5: Worker Army Deployment ✅
- **Original Fractal Workers (10)**: Core system coordination
- **Infrastructure Workers (5)**: Docker and deployment specialists
- **Advanced Fractal Army (15)**: Specialized optimization team
  - CodeArchitects, PerformanceOptimizers, SecurityAuditors
  - TestMasters, DockerExperts, InfrastructureEngineers
  - PlaybookGenerators, SystemMonitors

### Phase 6: Final Validation & Smoke Tests ✅
- Comprehensive endpoint testing
- API response validation
- Performance metrics collection
- Zero-failure deployment confirmation

python fractal_worker_spawner.py    # Core worker management
```

### Autonomous Learning
```bash
python axiom_configure.py --status              # Check system status
python axiom_configure.py --monitor             # Live monitoring
python demo_autonomous_learning.py              # Learning demonstration
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
python log3_red_team_analysis.py               # Failure analysis
python log4_fractal_tessellation.py            # System optimization
python execution_mode_comparison.py            # Performance metrics
```
