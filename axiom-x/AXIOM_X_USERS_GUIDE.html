<h2 id="the-simple-guide-to-getting-things-done-faster">The Simple Guide to Getting Things Done Faster</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-axiom-x">🎯 What Is Axiom-X?</h3>
<p><strong>In one sentence:</strong> Axiom-X coordinates multiple AI assistants to work together on big tasks, following ethical rules to ensure safe and high-quality results.</p>
<p><strong>Think of it like:</strong>
- A conductor leading an orchestra of AI musicians
- A project manager coordinating a team of specialists
- A quality control system that ensures good work</p>
<p><strong>The key difference:</strong> Instead of asking one AI to do everything (slow), Axiom-X breaks work into pieces and assigns them to hundreds of AI workers simultaneously (fast).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-can-axiom-x-do">📊 WHAT CAN AXIOM-X DO?</h2>
<h3 id="feature-1-multi-provider-orchestration">Feature 1: Multi-Provider Orchestration</h3>
<p><strong>What it means in plain English:</strong>
- Uses 6 different AI companies at once (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, Cohere, Fireworks)
- If one is slow or breaks, others keep working
- Never locked into one company's limitations</p>
<p><strong>When to use it:</strong>
- You have lots of similar tasks (analyze 100 documents, write 50 emails)
- You need results fast
- You want backup options if one AI service has problems</p>
<p><strong>Example use cases:</strong>
- "Analyze these 200 research papers and summarize key findings"
- "Generate 100 product descriptions for my catalog"
- "Review 500 support tickets and categorize them"</p>
<p><strong>Quick Start Prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>I need to [task] for [number] items. Use multi-provider orchestration for speed.

Examples:
- &quot;I need to summarize 50 PDFs. Use multi-provider orchestration for speed.&quot;
- &quot;I need to generate SEO descriptions for 200 products. Use multi-provider orchestration.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Axiom-X splits your 50 tasks across 6 AI providers, completing in ~2 minutes instead of 30 minutes.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="feature-2-constitutional-governance">Feature 2: Constitutional Governance</h3>
<p><strong>What it means in plain English:</strong>
- Every decision follows ethical rules (based on ancient Yama principles)
- Always asks permission before deleting anything

<p><strong>When to use it:</strong>
- Working with important documents
- Making decisions that affect others
- Need to prove work meets ethical standards
- Want audit trail for compliance</p>
<p><strong>Example use cases:</strong>
- "Review these legal contracts and flag risky clauses" (needs high accuracy + ethics)
- "Analyze employee feedback and summarize concerns" (needs confidentiality)
- "Recommend budget cuts" (needs transparency about tradeoffs)</p>
<p><strong>Quick Start Prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[Your task] - Use constitutional governance to ensure ethical compliance.

Examples:
- &quot;Analyze customer complaints - Use constitutional governance to ensure privacy.&quot;
- &quot;Recommend which features to cut - Use constitutional governance for transparent tradeoffs.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Axiom-X follows ethical rules (non-harm, truthfulness, proper attribution) and provides confidence scores with every answer.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="feature-3-fractal-parallelization-swarm-mode">Feature 3: Fractal Parallelization (Swarm Mode)</h3>
<p><strong>What it means in plain English:</strong>
- Breaks big problems into smaller pieces
- Assigns pieces to hundreds of AI workers
- Combines results intelligently
- 50-100× faster than working alone</p>
<p><strong>When to use it:</strong>
- Massive tasks (thousands of items)
- Complex analysis requiring multiple perspectives
- Time-sensitive projects
- Research requiring comprehensive coverage</p>
<p><strong>Example use cases:</strong>
- "Scan my entire codebase (1,000+ files) and find security vulnerabilities"
- "Research all competitors in my industry and create comparison matrix"
- "Analyze 10 years of financial data and identify patterns"</p>
<p><strong>Quick Start Prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[Large task] - Deploy swarm mode with [number] workers.

Examples:
- &quot;Analyze all 500 customer reviews - Deploy swarm mode with 100 workers.&quot;
- &quot;Find duplicates in my 2,000 file photo library - Deploy swarm mode with 200 workers.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Axiom-X spawns hundreds of specialized workers, completes your task in minutes instead of hours/days.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="feature-4-receipt-based-performance-tracking">Feature 4: Receipt-Based Performance Tracking</h3>
<p><strong>What it means in plain English:</strong>
- Every time a script runs, it saves a "report card"
- Report cards show speed, quality, and success/failure
- System learns which scripts work best
- Automatically uses top performers for future tasks</p>
<p><strong>When to use it:</strong>
- Building tools you'll reuse
- Want to know what's working vs failing
- Need proof of performance for stakeholders
- Optimizing workflows over time</p>
<p><strong>Example use cases:</strong>

<p><strong>Quick Start Prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[Your task] - Generate performance receipt for tracking.

Examples:
- &quot;Run data analysis pipeline - Generate performance receipt for tracking.&quot;
- &quot;Benchmark these 5 approaches - Generate performance receipts to compare.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Axiom-X saves detailed performance data (speed, quality, errors) in JSON files you can review later.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="feature-5-canonical-file-selection">Feature 5: Canonical File Selection</h3>
<p><strong>What it means in plain English:</strong>
- Automatically identifies your "best" files
- Flags duplicate/outdated versions for cleanup
- Keeps your codebase organized
- Prevents accumulation of junk files</p>
<p><strong>When to use it:</strong>
- Your project has grown messy
- Multiple versions of files exist
- Not sure which script to use
- Want to clean up without breaking things</p>
<p><strong>Example use cases:</strong>
- "I have 5 versions of my data processing script - which one should I keep?"
- "My project has 1,000+ files - help me identify what's important"
- "Clean up my codebase without breaking anything"</p>
<p><strong>Quick Start Prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Run canonical file selection on [directory/project].

Examples:
- &quot;Run canonical file selection on my Python project.&quot;
- &quot;Run canonical file selection on my scripts folder - flag duplicates.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Axiom-X analyzes performance data, identifies best versions of each tool, flags redundant files for safe deletion.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="feature-6-infrastructure-workers-continuous-development">Feature 6: Infrastructure Workers (Continuous Development)</h3>
<p><strong>What it means in plain English:</strong>

- Provides audit trail
- Ensures ethical compliance</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Let Receipt Tracking Run</strong>
- After a few runs, you'll see patterns
- System learns what works best
- Performance improves automatically</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Review Canonical Recommendations</strong>
- Don't auto-delete files
- Human approval is required (Ahimsa principle)
- Keep backups of deleted files</p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Combine Features</strong>
- "Use multi-provider orchestration WITH constitutional governance"
- "Deploy swarm mode AND generate performance receipts"
- Features work better together</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="troubleshooting">🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> "It's too slow"
- Solution: Increase worker count or use fractal parallelization</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> "Results aren't accurate"
- Solution: Add constitutional governance for quality checks</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> "I don't trust the recommendations"
- Solution: Check confidence scores and constitutional receipts</p>
