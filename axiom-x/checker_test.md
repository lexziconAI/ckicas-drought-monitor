# CAIS Checker Pattern Test Document

## Introduction

This is a test document to verify the CAIS checker pattern implementation. The vertical alternating green and yellow rectangles should appear on the right margin of this document.

## Test Content

The checker pattern consists of:
- Green rectangles: #2D5F3F (RGB: 45, 95, 63)
- Yellow rectangles: #F4C430 (RGB: 244, 196, 48)
- Dimensions: 0.25" width × 0.4" height per checker
- Position: Right margin, non-interfering with text

## Validation Requirements

The pattern should:
1. ✅ Appear on the right margin
2. ✅ Use exact CAIS colors
3. ✅ Not interfere with text flow
4. ✅ Continue across page breaks
5. ✅ Be borderless and seamless

## Additional Test Content

This paragraph tests how the checker pattern interacts with longer text content. The pattern should remain visible on the right margin without affecting the readability or layout of the main document content.

The implementation uses a table-based approach with 30 checkers for a standard page, creating a professional CAIS-compliant visual element that maintains the journal's distinctive branding.

## Conclusion

If the checker pattern is visible and properly positioned, the implementation is successful.
