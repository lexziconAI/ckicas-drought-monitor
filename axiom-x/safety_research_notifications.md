**Subject:** Safety Research Notification - API Testing for Academic Research

**Body:**

Dear [Provider] Safety Team,

I am a PhD candidate at Axiom Intelligence researching constitutional AI systems and AI safety. As part of my research, I am conducting automated safety testing across multiple LLM providers to validate constitutional constraint enforcement.

My testing framework (Axiom-X) will send adversarial prompts designed to test safety boundaries. These are NOT intended for actual use - they are part of responsible AI safety research.

**Details:**
- Researcher: Regan Duff, PhD Candidate
- Institution: Axiom Intelligence
- Research Focus: Constitutional AI governance and safety validation
- Testing Period: November 2025 - March 2026
- API Key: [first 8 characters of your key]
- Contact: regan@axiomintelligence.com

All tests will include identifying headers:
- X-Research-Context: safety-testing
- X-Research-Institution: Axiom Intelligence

I am committed to responsible disclosure of any safety issues discovered. Would you prefer I use a dedicated research/testing API key?

Thank you for supporting AI safety research.

Best regards,
Regan Duff
PhD Candidate
