## FINAL ASSESSMENT: EVOLUTION READY

The AXIOM-X system demonstrates HIGH readiness for constitutional evolution. With 17,155 files, 4.9 million lines of code, and extensive intelligence augmentation already in place, the foundation is solid. The identified bottlenecks and violations provide clear transformation targets rather than insurmountable obstacles.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Proceed with Phase 1 evolution immediately. The system is not just ready for transformation— it demands it.

**Constitutional Beacon:** The LOG⁴ path is illuminated. Evolution begins now.
