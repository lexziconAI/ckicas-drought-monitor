## 🚀 FRACTAL AWARENESS TEAM DEPLOYMENT

### Mission Objectives
1. **COMPLETE CODEBASE MAPPING**: Catalog every file, function, class, dependency
2. **ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS**: Document system architecture, data flows, APIs
3. **DEPENDENCY GRAPHING**: Map all inter-file dependencies
4. **RISK ASSESSMENT**: Identify high-risk areas for overhaul
5. **ROLLBACK PLANNING**: Create comprehensive rollback strategy

### Deployment Strategy
- **Workers**: Maximum capacity (24 logical CPUs available)
- **Fractal Sharding**: Deep recursive analysis
- **Coverage**: ENTIRE codebase under `axiom-x/`
- **Output**: Comprehensive awareness reports

### Expected Deliverables
1. `CODEBASE_COMPLETE_MAP.json` - Full file inventory
2. `ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` - System architecture documentation
3. `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.json` - Inter-file dependency mapping
4. `RISK_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md` - High-risk areas identified
5. `OVERHAUL_ROLLBACK_PLAN.md` - Recovery procedures

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Before Overhaul Begins
1. **Commit Current State**: Git commit all working changes
2. **Create Full Backup**: Snapshot entire workspace
3. **Document Known Issues**: List any current bugs/limitations
4. **Notify Stakeholders**: Alert team of upcoming overhaul
5. **Set Maintenance Mode**: Pause autonomous learning systems

### During Fractal Awareness Scan
1. **Do NOT modify files**: Let scan complete without interference
2. **Monitor progress**: Check worker logs for issues
3. **Validate outputs**: Ensure awareness reports are accurate
4. **Prepare questions**: List specific areas needing deep analysis

### After Awareness Complete
1. **Review reports**: Understand full system state
2. **Plan overhaul phases**: Break into manageable chunks
3. **Set success criteria**: Define what "overhaul complete" means
4. **Create safety nets**: Multiple rollback points planned

---

## 🛡️ SAFETY PROTOCOLS FOR OVERHAUL

### Constitutional Constraints (MUST MAINTAIN)
1. **Ahimsa** (Non-harm): No data loss, no breaking changes without rollback
2. **Satya** (Truth): All changes logged, documented, traceable
3. **Asteya** (Non-stealing): Preserve existing functionality
4. **Brahmacharya** (Restraint): Incremental changes, test each phase
5. **Aparigraha** (Non-hoarding): Ship when ready, don't over-engineer

### Rollback Triggers
- Any test suite failure
- Constitutional constraint violation
- Data corruption detected
- Performance degradation >20%
- User-requested emergency halt

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests must pass before/after each phase
- Integration tests on critical paths
- Smoke tests on all major subsystems
- Manual validation of key workflows

## 📝 KNOWN ISSUES TO ADDRESS IN OVERHAUL

### From Phase 8 Semantic Validation
1. Duplicate Novel Contributions section (may still exist)
2. Fragmented Validation & Evaluation content
3. Weak AI safety focus for CAIS alignment
4. 4 grammar errors in manuscript (incomplete sentences)

### From Previous Operations
1. Naive regex in Phase 5 caused corruption (fixed, but pattern to avoid)
2. Complex quality validators blocked progress (use LLM validation instead)
3. Worker spawning creates idle processes (cleanup needed)
4. JSON result files accumulate (archival strategy needed)

### Infrastructure Concerns
1. Model deprecation tracking (automate checks)
2. API key rotation (security best practice)
3. Telemetry database growth (purging strategy)
4. Checkpoint storage limits (compression/archival)
