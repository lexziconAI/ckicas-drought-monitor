                <h3>Line 23: Passive Voice</h3>
                <p><strong>Original:</strong> The literature on AI in research contexts has grown substantially in recent years. Studies have shown  AI tools can significantly improve research efficiency and quality. For example, natural language processing algorithms are being used to analyze large volumes of academic literature. Machine learning techniques are applied to identify patterns in research data  might not be apparent through traditional methods. Despite these benefits, concerns have been raised about the potential for AI to introduce bias into research processes. Additionally, questions remain about the transparency and explainability of AI-generated insights.</p>
                <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Consider converting to active voice</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> CAIS prefers active voice for clarity and directness</p>
