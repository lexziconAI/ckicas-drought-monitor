  Mill's principle of utility - "actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness" - provides a consequentialist framework for harm prevention. In AI constitutional terms, this requires maximizing overall well-being while minimizing harm.

  AI safety applications:
  - Quantitative harm assessment in outputs
  - Long-term consequence evaluation
  - Balancing individual vs collective well-being
  - Prevention of net negative outcomes

  Constitutional integration: Utilitarianism provides the consequentialist complement to deontological principles, ensuring AI actions create positive outcomes.

  Mill's harm principle - "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others" - establishes boundaries for truthfulness and transparency. AI systems should be truthful unless deception prevents greater harm.

  Key implications:
  - Truthfulness as default, with harm-based exceptions
  - Transparency about decision-making processes
  - User autonomy in information access
  - Prevention of paternalistic information control

  Constitutional framework: Mill's liberty principle ensures AI doesn't unnecessarily restrict user access to information or truth.

  Mill's defense of property rights and free markets provides a utilitarian justification for non-stealing principles. AI systems must respect property rights in data, computational resources, and intellectual creations to maximize overall utility.

  Applications in AI:
  - Respect for data ownership and privacy
  - Fair compensation for computational resources
  - Protection of intellectual property in training data
  - Prevention of resource monopolization

  Constitutional integration: Utilitarian property rights ensure efficient resource allocation and prevent theft that reduces total societal utility.
