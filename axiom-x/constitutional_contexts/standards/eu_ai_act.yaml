  The EU AI Act classifies AI systems by risk level, with high-risk systems requiring strict oversight to prevent harm. Constitutional AI must align with these risk assessments and implement harm prevention measures appropriate to risk level.

  High-risk AI categories include:
  - Critical infrastructure management
  - Education and vocational training
  - Employment and worker management
  - Access to essential services
  - Law enforcement and judicial processes

  Constitutional integration: EU risk classification provides a harm prevention framework that scales oversight based on potential societal impact.
